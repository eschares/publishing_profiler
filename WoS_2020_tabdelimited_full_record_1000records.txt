J	Prieto, LR				Prieto, Loreto R.			Concerns about teaching culturally diverse students in a cross-disciplinary sample of higher education faculty	TEACHING IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						Higher education faculty; cultural competence		I examined concerns surrounding teaching culturally diverse students held by a cross-disciplinary sample of higher education faculty at a major Midwestern university in the United States. Findings indicated as faculty levels of acceptance of culturally diverse students increased, negative faculty attitudes toward these students decreased, as did faculty concerns that these students might hold negative perceptions toward them. A greater acceptance of culturally diverse students was also associated with a faculty assigning greater importance to incorporating content regarding cultural diversity into their courses, and spending more time discussing diversity issues in class. Faculty identified chief barriers concerning the incorporation of diversity issues into their course content as: (1) not finding diversity issues relevant to their course content; (2) time constraints; and, (3) student apprehension about faculty including diversity content in courses.

In this short note, simple examples are used to demonstrate potential problems with the independence screening methods in the presence of correlated predictors. Also, an example is considered where all important variables are independent among themselves and all but one important variables are independent with the unimportant variables. Furthermore, a real data example from a genome-wide association study is used to illustrate inferior performance of marginal correlation screening compared to another screening method.

J	Zheng, XF; Wei, P				Zheng, Xufang; Wei, Peng			Air Transportation Direct Share Time Series Forecasting: A Hybrid Model	JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							LOW-COST CARRIERS; NEURAL-NETWORK; RANDOM FOREST; PASSENGER; ARIMA; DEMAND; CHOICE	In modern air transportation, the direct share is the ratio of direct passengers to total passengers on a directional origin and destination (O&D) pair. The forecasting of direct share time series on the O&D level, as part of the detailed demand forecasting, plays a fundamental role in air transportation planning and development. An accurate forecasting of the O&D direct share time series can benefit the air transportation planners, airlines, and airports in multiple ways. Based on the previous analysis, the direct share time series is O&D specific. This research focuses on developing accurate direct share time series forecasting models on O&D markets with different characteristics. Both classical time series models and supervised learning regression models are investigated carefully. A novel hybrid model that combines time series concept and machine learning modeling techniques is proposed, which can provide more accurate forecasting performance and valuable insights into the O&D markets. To automatically select the forecasting model for each O&D pair, a general modeling framework is proposed for direct share time series forecasting. Based on the forecasting performance comparison, the modeling framework can provide promising direct share time series forecasting, which is a reliable replacement for the model used in the Federal Aviation Administration Terminal Area Forecast.

Tear Film Pharmacokinetics and Systemic Absorption Following Topical Administration of 1% Prednisolone Acetate Ophthalmic Suspension in Dogs	FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE			English	Article						prednisolone acetate; pharmacokinetics; corticosteroid; tear film; systemic absorption; ocular pharmacology; tear collection; canine	ADRENAL-GLAND; DEXAMETHASONE; CORTICOSTEROIDS; EYE; PENETRATION; HYDROCORTISONE; DIFLUPREDNATE; 0.05-PERCENT; DELIVERY; ANTERIOR	The study aimed to determine the tear film pharmacokinetics following topical administration of 1% prednisolone acetate-assessing whether two drops would provide a superior kinetic profile compared to one drop-and to determine the fraction of an eye drop that reaches the systemic circulation in dogs. Two separate experiments were conducted in eight healthy Beagle dogs: (i) Instillation of 1 drop (35 mu L) or 2 drops (70 mu L) of 1% prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension in each eye, followed by tear collections with Schirmer strips from 0 to 720 min; (ii) Instillation of 1 or 2 drops of 1% prednisolone acetate in both eyes 4 times daily for 3 days, followed by blood collection 10-15 min after each topical administration on Day 3. Tear and blood samples were analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography to determine the levels of prodrug (prednisolone acetate), active metabolite (prednisolone) and total prednisolone (prednisolone(total) = prodrug + active metabolite). Prednisolone levels represented 10 and 72% of prednisolone(total) concentrations in tears and plasma, respectively, indicating a greater hydrolysis of prodrug in the blood vs. tear compartment. For eyes receiving one or two drops, tear film prednisolone(total) concentrations were high (similar to 3.1 mg/mL) immediately following topical administration but rapidly decreased by similar to 45% at 1 min and similar to 95% at 15 min. No differences were noted between 1 vs. 2 drops in tear film prednisolone(total) concentrations (including maximal concentration, C-max) or residual drug levels in tears at any time point (P >= 0.097); however, instillation of 2 drops provided a higher average tear concentration (C-avg) and overall drug exposure to the ocular surface (AUC(last)) over the 12-h sampling period (P = 0.009). Average plasma prednisolone(total) concentration represented <= 2% of the dose applied to the ocular surface, and did not differ significantly for dogs receiving 1 drop (17 ng/mL) or 2 drops (20 ng/mL) 4 times daily for 3 days (P = 0.438). In sum, topical corticotherapy is beneficial for inflammatory conditions of the canine anterior segment given the relatively high concentrations achieved in tears, although caution is warranted to prevent unwanted local or systemic adverse effects.

No information is available on protein oxidation in these products. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which typical antioxidant inclusion at different storage conditions may limit protein oxidation in typical rendered protein meals. Two experiments were conducted on 14 rendered products stored at either 45 degrees C for 7 or 14 d, or at 20 degrees C for 3 or 6 mo to determine the extent to which time, temperature, and antioxidants affect protein oxidation. Results from this study show that fish meal and chicken blood meal are susceptible to protein oxidation during storage at 45 degrees C (P = 0.05; 0.03) as well as during storage at 20 degrees C (P = 0.01; 0.04). Natural antioxidants were effective at limiting carbonyl formation in fish meal during short-term storage at 45 degrees C, whereas ethoxyquin was effective at limiting the extent of protein oxidation in fish meal stored long term at 20 degrees C.

This claim can be evaluated longitudinally by examining the extent to which changes in stop consonant perception predict changes in stop consonant production. Taking a time-sensitive view of the perception-production link, this study used longitudinal data to analyze perception as a time-varying predictor of production accuracy. Mixed-effects models were fit to oddity, delayed word repetition, and picture description tasks to examine how participants' perception and production changed over time. Oddity task perception data were then decomposed into their between- and within-subjects components and integrated into the delayed repetition and picture description production models. Surprisingly, only the between-subjects predictors reached significance, and the strength of the perception-production link varied across production tasks and target phones. The methods used have implications for future research on perception-production links.

To quantify this risk utilities need to solve the interactive equations of tripping events for networked PVs in real-time. However, these equations are non-differentiable, nonlinear, and exponentially complex, and thus, cannot be used as a tractable basis for solar curtailment prediction and mitigation. Furthermore, load/PV power values might not be available in real-time due to limited grid observability, which further complicates tripping event prediction. To address these challenges, we have employed Chebyshev's inequality to obtain an alternative probabilistic model for quantifying the risk of tripping for networked PVs. The proposed model enables operators to estimate the probability of interdependent inverter tripping events using only PV/load statistics and in a scalable manner. Furthermore, by integrating this probabilistic model into an optimization framework, countermeasures are designed to mitigate massive interdependent tripping events. Since the proposed model is parameterized using only the statistical characteristics of nodal active/reactive powers, it is especially beneficial in practical systems, which have limited real-time observability. Numerical experiments have been performed employing real data and feeder models to verify the performance of the proposed technique.

Evaluating students with online testing modules in engineering economics: A comparision of student performance with online testing and with traditional assessments	ENGINEERING ECONOMIST			English	Article							IMPROVES PERFORMANCE; DISHONESTY; ANXIETY; MODEL	Engineering economics courses often require students to take time-constrained, in-class exams in which they solve problems by hand, possibly referring to interest rate tables. Many students rely on partial credit to successfully pass exams. Outside of the classroom, professionals rely on computers to solve engineering economics problems, which raises the question of whether engineering economics courses are correctly assessing student performance. This article describes the study of a large engineering economics class using a non-conventional testing method. Student performance was evaluated using online testing modules with a stringent passing criterion, and the tests could be taken multiple times. The questions for each testing attempt were pulled from a database so that students received a new question every time. We compare the performance of students who were assessed using traditional methods with the performance of students assessed with these online testing modules. Our analysis shows that, overall, students who were assessed using the online testing modules earned better grades than students who were assessed via traditional methods. The analysis also discusses several benefits and drawbacks to using online assessments compared with traditional methods. The online assessment method could be useful in large engineering courses that are formula-based.

Interactions between intestinal stem cells and Engineered Nanomaterials (ENMs) are an essential area in research with the growing diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. One unique type of two-dimensional metal carbide nanomaterial, niobium carbide (Nb2C), has shown promising properties for potential applications in this field, such as biocompatibility, stability, and high photothermal conversion efficiency. In this study, Nb2C nanosheets were prepared by spark plasma sintering and HF etching. Various concentrations of Nb2C nanosheets were placed inside intestinal organoids, which mimic the real functions of an intestinal system. These organoids were formed from intestinal crypts that were isolated from mice and grew into self-maintained systems. Through growth analysis, surface area calculations, and cell viability tests, it was concluded that an optimal concentration of nanosheets exists that may offer stimulation to intestinal cells while having no toxic effects. A high concentration of nanosheets in the organoids inhibited growth, whereas the control and low concentration of nanosheets showed no reduced growth rate. When placed under infrared exposure, the organoids with nanosheets offered stimulation and showed more viability after time as compared to the control organoids with no nanosheets. These results show overall potential benefits of placing low concentration Nb2C nanosheets in intestinal systems to protect and stimulate cell survivability when undergoing various treatments.

For model estimation, we propose a nonparametric quasi-likelihood approach using the bivariate penalized spline approximation technique. We show that our estimation procedure is able to handle irregularly-shaped spatial domains with complex boundaries. Under some regularity conditions, the estimator for the coefficient function is proved to be consistent in the L-2 sense and its convergence rate is established. We develop a numerically stable algorithm using penalized iteratively reweighted least squares method to estimate the coefficient functions in GSVCMs. To gain efficiency in the computation for large-scale data, we further propose a QR decomposition-based algorithm, which requires only sub-blocks of the design matrix to be computed at a time, so that it allows efficient estimation of GSVCMs for large datasets with modest computer hardware. The finite sample performance of the GSVCM and its estimation method is examined by simulations studies. The proposed method is also illustrated by an analysis of the crash data in Florida. for this article are available online.

Upper Airway Obstruction Due to Primary Laryngeal Blastomycosis in a Dog	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ANIMAL HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							CANINE BLASTOMYCOSIS; DIAGNOSIS; THERAPY	A 9 yr old female spayed Labrador retriever presented for progressive dyspnea. Inspiratory stridor and inspiratory and expiratory dyspnea were present, consistent with an upper airway obstruction. A laryngeal exam revealed severe thickening of the arytenoid cartilages and masses associated with the arytenoids. A tracheostomy tube was placed, and the masses were biopsied. Histopathology showed pyogranulomatous inflammation secondary to Blastomyces dermatitidis. The dog was initially treated with amphotericin B and terbinafine in the hospital until the airway obstruction resolved and the tracheostomy tube could be removed. The dog experienced complete recovery after long-term treatment with itraconazole and terbinafine. This is the first report of laryngeal obstruction secondary to primary laryngeal blastomycosis in a dog. Blastomycosis should be considered for cases of obstructive laryngeal disease, and a good outcome can be achieved with antifungal treatment.

The seemingly random distribution of sex-determining systems in reptiles offers a unique opportunity to study sex chromosome evolution not afforded by mammals or birds. These reptilian systems derive from multiple transitions in sex determination, some independent, some convergent, that lead to the birth and death of sex chromosomes in various lineages. Here we focus on turtles, an emerging model group with growing genomic resources. We review karyotypic changes that accompanied the evolution of chromosomal systems of genotypic sex determination (GSD) in chelonians from systems under the control of environmental temperature (TSD). These transitions gave rise to 31 GSD species identified thus far (out of 101 turtles with known sex determination), 27 with a characterized sex chromosome system (13 of those karyotypically). These sex chromosomes are varied in terms of the ancestral autosome they co-opted and thus in their homology, as well as in their size (some are macro-, some are micro-chromosomes), heterogamety (some are XX/XY, some ZZ/ZW), dimorphism (some are virtually homomorphic, some heteromorphic with larger-X, larger W, or smaller-Y), age (the oldest system could be similar to 195 My old and the youngest < 25 My old). Combined, all data indicate that turtles follow some tenets of classic theoretical models of sex chromosome evolution while countering others. Finally, although the study of dosage compensation and molecular divergence of turtle sex chromosomes has lagged behind research on other aspects of their evolution, this gap is rapidly decreasing with the acceleration of ongoing research and growing genomic resources in this group.

We generalize the power domination problem to hypergraphs using the infection rule from Bergen et al. (2018): given an initial set of observed vertices, S-0, a set A subset of S-0 may infect an edge e if A subset of e and for any unobserved vertex v, if A boolean OR {v} is contained in an edge, then v is an element of e. We combine a domination step with this infection rule to create infectious power domination. We compare this new parameter to the previous generalization by Chang and Roussel (2015).

J	Guirguis, M; Buss, A				Guirguis, Minas; Buss, Ashley			Adopting Chip Sealing Performance-Based Approaches to Determine Rational Design Quantities	JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION			English	Article						chip seal; performance; pavement design; seal coats; flexible pavements; high-performance pavements		Chip seal research advocates for performing rational design computations prior to construction to determine the initial chip and binder application rates. Research indicated that a major concern in chip seal construction industry is the lack of following a formal/documented computational design approach. This study is a result of research that investigatedways to improve chip seal design specifications in Oregon State, focusing on field application rates. The objective of this article is to encourage agencies and contractors to adopt a formal established design approach to determine their aggregates and binder application rates. This is established through identifying the parameters considered in the design while showing straightforward procedures to follow formal design approaches. Chip seal design calls for conducting laboratory and field evaluations and uses the results as input data to estimate the appropriate quantities of materials. Thus, involved parties at the design stage are required to (1) understand the properties of chip seal materials (aggregate and binder), (2) identify the pre-seal road condition, and (3) use said information in the design process. This study uses various roadways located in Klamath Falls, Oregon to verify the importance of using rational design procedures. The roadways were constructed in accordance with Oregon Department of Transportation specifications; however, application rates were based upon the agency's previous experience rather than using a rational design approach. The study compares roadways' infield application rates and rationally estimated rates based upon two commonly used methodologies, namely McLeod and New Zealand. Findings shows that roadways constructed using infield application rates close to the rationally estimated rates had better embedment and a longer predicted life span when compared to the rest of roadways that had excessive aggregate amounts and less binder content.

Midwest Consumer Shopping Habits, Nutrition Knowledge, and Latino Tienda Use	HEALTH BEHAVIOR AND POLICY REVIEW			English	Article						nutrition knowledge; food safety; healthcare; Latinas; Mexican-Americans; tiendas	HEALTHY FOOD; STORE CHOICE; LOW-INCOME; ACCULTURATION; AVAILABILITY; ENVIRONMENT	Objective: In this study, we assessed the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and community influences on nutrition knowledge, views on healthy foods, grocery store choice, and grocery shopping patterns specifically at Latino tiendas, among Midwestern adults by Hispanic or non-Hispanic ethnicity. Methods: We surveyed a convenience sample of adults on an open-ended definition of healthy foods, nutrition knowledge, shopping behaviors, and reasons for store choice. Results: Of the 149 respondents, no ethnic differences were observed in qualitative definitions of healthy foods (low fat, unprocessed, high nutrient content). Fewer Hispanics than non-Hispanics correctly identified healthier options for rice, canned fruits, and canned tuna. Respondents indicated that proximity to home and food price were motivators of store choice. Significantly more Hispanics than non-Hispanics shopped at Walmart (42% vs 15%; p < .001), and at tiendas (77% vs 14%; p < .001). Food selection was the most frequent reason given by all for shopping at tiendas. Conclusions: Hispanics and non-Hispanics share similar views of healthy food definitions and important store characteristics. Non-Hispanics could potentially use tiendas more frequently considering expressed interests in food prices and selection. Some healthier food options that are culturally important were less known by Hispanics. Further research with a larger sample is needed to substantiate these preliminary findings.

Lithium Thiosilicophosphate Glassy Solid Electrolytes Synthesized by High-Energy Ball-Milling and Melt-Quenching: Improved Suppression of Lithium Dendrite Growth by Si Doping	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						solid-state electrolytes; sulfide glass; silicon; grain-boundary-free; lithium dendrite; short-range order	ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; MECHANOCHEMICAL SYNTHESIS; INTERPHASE FORMATION; CONDUCTIVE GLASS; SILICON ANODES; SYSTEM; LI; BATTERY; RAMAN; CERAMICS	Due to the volatility of P2S5, the ambient pressure synthesis of Li2S + P2S5 (LPS) has been limited to planetary ball-milling (PBM). To utilize PBM of LPS to generate a solid electrolyte (SE), the as-synthesized powder sample must be pressed into pellets, and as such the presence of as-pressed grain boundaries in the SE cannot be avoided. To eliminate the grain boundaries, LPS doped with SiS2 has been studied because SiS2 lowers the vapor pressure of the melt and promotes strong glass formation, which in combination allows for greater ease in synthesis. In this work, we have examined the structures and electrochemical properties of lithium thiosilicophosphate 0.6Li(2)S + 0.4[xSiS(2) + 1.5(1 - x)PS5/2], 0 <= x <= 1, glassy solid electrolytes (GSEs) prepared by both PBM and melt-quenching (MOD. It is shown that the critical current density improved after incorporating SiS2, reaching 1.5 mA/cm(2) for the x = 0.8 composition. However, the interfacial reaction of MQ GSE with lithium metal introduced microcracks, which shows that further research is needed to explore and develop more stable GSE compositions. These fundamental results can help to understand the interface reaction and formation and as such can provide a guide to design improved homogeneous GSEs with SiS2 as a glass former, which have no grain boundaries and thereby may help suppress lithium dendrite formation.

J	Du, XS; Leifsson, L				Du, Xiaosong; Leifsson, Leifur			Efficient uncertainty propagation for MAPOD via polynomial chaos-based Kriging	ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS			English	Article						Uncertainty propagation; Metamodeling; Model-assisted probability of detection; Polynomial chaos-based Kriging; Ultrasonic testing	MODEL-ASSISTED PROBABILITY; EDDY-CURRENT INSPECTION; VALIDATION; SCATTERING	Purpose Model-assisted probability of detection (MAPOD) is an important approach used as part of assessing the reliability of nondestructive testing systems. The purpose of this paper is to apply the polynomial chaos-based Kriging (PCK) metamodeling method to MAPOD for the first time to enable efficient uncertainty propagation, which is currently a major bottleneck when using accurate physics-based models. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the state-of-the-art Kriging, polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) and PCK are applied to "(a) over cap vs a"-based MAPOD of ultrasonic testing (UT) benchmark problems. In particular, Kriging interpolation matches the observations well, while PCE is capable of capturing the global trend accurately. The proposed UP approach for MAPOD using PCK adopts the PCE bases as the trend function of the universal Kriging model, aiming at combining advantages of both metamodels. Findings To reach a pre-set accuracy threshold, the PCK method requires 50 per cent fewer training points than the PCE method, and around one order of magnitude fewer than Kriging for the test cases considered. The relative differences on the key MAPOD metrics compared with those from the physics-based models are controlled within 1 per cent. Originality/value The contributions of this work are the first application of PCK metamodel for MAPOD analysis, the first comparison between PCK with the current state-of-the-art metamodels for MAPOD and new MAPOD results for the UT benchmark cases.

Other reading challenges, such as rotation sensitivity, add to the reader requirements and to the implementation constraints current reader systems have. This work proposes a monostatic chipless RFID tag reading methodology that utilizes a dual circularly-polarized antenna which is capable of reading frequency-based chipless RFID tags independent of their scattering polarization. Additionally, this method provides results for six distinct polarizations with one straightforward two-port measurement and one simple matrix transformation. These six polarizations provide more information about the tag and allow for hybrid chipless RFID coding schemes to be more easily implemented than with other reading schemes that would require multiple measurements. The optimized design of the antenna is presented and the reading methodology is demonstrated through both simulation and measurement utilizing a 3D printed version of the antenna.

Post-Project Evaluation and Lessons Learned	CONSTRUCTION RESEARCH CONGRESS 2020: PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND CONTROLS, MATERIALS, AND CONTRACTS			English	Proceedings Paper	Construction Research Congress (CRC) on Construction Research and Innovation to Transform Society	MAR 08-10, 2020	Arizona State Univ, Del E Webb Sch Construct, Tempe, AZ	Construct Res Council, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Construct Inst, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Arizona State Univ	Arizona State Univ, Del E Webb Sch Construct			Lessons learned could be used on construction of all types in order to improve quality, avoid change orders and claims, and to control schedule and budget. An evaluation of the construction after its completion can help the organization to acquire lessons learned. However, some organizations do not see the benefit of this post-construction phase and end up ignoring it. The transportation management plan (TMP) is a document that includes strategies to help manage the work zone and secure the safety of workers and traveling public during highway construction. This document could also have a post-project evaluation with the same purpose as the post-construction evaluation. This study investigated twenty-six state Departments of Transportation (DOTs), through survey and interviews, to determine if the DOTs track TMP changes, perform post-project evaluations, and if there is a transfer of the lessons learned regarding TMPs. It was found that a majority of the agencies track the changes and perform the evaluation. However, only seven DOTs have a template to develop the evaluation, and many times the template might not be used due to vagueness or different employees' interpretation. Moreover, most of the DOTs have an informal transfer of lessons learned, which does not guarantee a document for them. Based on this study, the results indicate that the three major problems encountered by the DOTs to develop the post-project evaluation are lack of personnel, lack of structured process review, and lack of resources. The problem with having the evaluation and not transferring lessons learned formally is that the knowledge ends up being personal rather than organizational. Overall, this study shows the necessity of a structured process across the country for the development of TMPs evaluation and transfer of lessons, and the obstacles the DOTs currently have to develop them.

This research explores statistical methods to provide a functional scoring for similarities. The investigation is conducted using two statistical methods (Pearsons correlation coefficient and image distance), two optical techniques (structured light and focus variation microscopy) and two application scenarios (metal additive printing and ballistic forensic examination). Experimental results show the promise of using statistical tools to assist binary decisions for matching/non-matching even if 3D topology data are obtained from different optical techniques.

Among possible solutions, the use of shrinkage-compensating cement concrete along with joint reinforcement has been in-vestigated in the current study through full-scale experimental tests and supporting numerical simulations. The shrinkage-compensating cement concrete offered the capability of producing controlled compressive stresses during the early stage of hydration, counteracting detrimental tensile stresses that originate from the shrinkage of concrete. Longitudinal and transverse reinforcements were also included in the joint to ensure the proper transfer of forces. The response of the full setup was evaluated under five million load cycles, including various loading protocols and boundary conditions. The measurements recorded from the experiments consisted of strains and deflections at critical locations. To expand the scope of this investigation and understand the effect of interfacial bond strength and joint reinforcement, a set of numerical simulations were also performed. Through a new combination of concrete mixture and reinforcement detail, this study provided a holistic strategy to resolve the long-standing issue of degradation of longitudinal joints in box-beam bridges.

J	Bix, AS				Bix, Amy Sue			'Remember the Sabbath': a history of technological decisions and innovation in Orthodox Jewish communities	HISTORY AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Judaism; Sabbath; electrification; household technologies		The relationship of Modern Orthodox Jewish communities to technology is mediated by the calendar, following requirements to keep the Sabbath holy. As nineteenth-, twentieth-, and twentyfirst-century inventions reshaped work, public spaces, and domestic living, rabbis intensely debated whether, how, and why observant Jewish people should avoid using electric switches, kitchen appliances, elevators, and other everyday devices on the Sabbath. To justify their decisions, rabbis interrogated minute technical details of these objects. Sabbath prohibitions promoted innovation, as rabbis collaborated with Jewish engineers to create what they judged to be Sabbath-compliant adaptions of everyday technologies. Given that prominent rabbis often disagreed about proper technology use on the Sabbath, Jewish families had the opportunity to decide for themselves what counted as authentic devotion in handling personal and domestic technologies.

J	Geredeli, PG				Guven Geredeli, Pelin			A time domain approach for the exponential stability of a linearized compressible flow-structure PDE system	MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN THE APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						flow-structure interaction; compressible flows; uniform stability	NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS; PARALLEL-FLOW; FLUID; DECAY; SEMIGROUP; BOUNDARY; NEUMANN	This work is motivated by a longstanding interest in the long time behavior of flow-structure interaction (FSI) PDE dynamics. We consider a linearized compressible flow structure interaction (FSI) PDE model with a view of analyzing the stability properties of both the compressible flow and plate solution components. In our earlier work, we gave an answer in the affirmative to question of uniform stability for finite energy solutions of said compressible flow-structure system, by means of a "frequency domain" approach. However, the frequency domain method of proof in that work is not "robust" (insofar as we can see), when one wishes to study longtime behavior of solutions of compressible flow-structure PDE models, which track the appearance of the ambient state onto the boundary interface. Nor is a frequency domain approach in this earlier work availing when one wishes to consider the dynamics, in long time, of solutions to physically relevant nonlinear versions of the compressible flow-structure PDE system under present consideration (e.g., the Navier-Stokes nonlinearity in the PDE flow component or a nonlinearity of Berger/Von Karman type in the plate equation). Accordingly, in the present work, we operate in the time domain by way of obtaining the necessary energy estimates, which culminate in an alternative proof for the uniform stability of finite energy compressible flow-structure solutions. Since there is a need to avoid steady states in our stability analysis, as a prerequisite result, we also show here that zero is an eigenvalue for the generators of flow-structure systems, whether the material derivative term be absent or present. Moreover, we provide a clean characterization of the (one dimensional) zero eigenspace, with or without material derivative, under an appropriate assumption on the underlying ambient vector field.

This raised a fundamental question concerning the long-term durability of reinforced concrete structures made with this type of cement. In the absence of similar studies, a comprehensive experimental testing program was devised in the current study to understand the vulnerability of steel bars embedded in shrinkage-compensating cement concretes exposed to corrosive environments. This included a long-term corrosion monitoring of reinforced concrete specimens made with different dosages of shrinkage-compensating cement. In addition to finding the corrosion rate of embedded steel bars, air permeability, capillary absorption, and chloride diffusion tests were conducted to determine the transport properties of the concretes made with this type of cement. The experimental test results were then further supported and explained using mercury intrusion porosimetry analyses.

The proposed controller applies a Proportional-Derivative feedback control law for each WEC with the optimized controller gains. A surrogate model, composed of only mechanical elements, is adopted to replace the hydrodynamic model during the optimization process. An indirect exterior penalty function approach is implemented to handle the constraints on the displacement and control. The weight of the penalty function is updated in subsequent iterations in the Sequential Unconstrained Minimization Technique. A numerical simulation is first conducted for identification of the surrogate model parameters. With the control gains optimized based on the surrogate model, the energy conversion is compared for three models: the surrogate model, a model that uses a boundary element tool to compute the hydrodynamic forces, and a simulation using AQWA. The results show a good agreement of the energy conversion among the models. Finally, the performance of the surrogate model is analyzed. It is shown that the proposed controller maximizes the energy conversion of the entire WEC array while satisfying the constraints. Moreover, the surrogate model can replace the hydrodynamic model to predict the system behavior with adequate accuracy and more efficiency. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Shahhosseini, M; Hu, GP; Archontoulis, SV				Shahhosseini, Mohsen; Hu, Guiping; Archontoulis, Sotirios V.			Forecasting Corn Yield With Machine Learning Ensembles	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						corn yields; machine learning; ensemble; forecasting; US Corn Belt	TIME-SERIES; RANDOM FORESTS; NITROGEN RATE; CROP; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; RESOLUTION; PROTOCOLS; ACCURACY; IMAGERY	The emergence of new technologies to synthesize and analyze big data with high-performance computing has increased our capacity to more accurately predict crop yields. Recent research has shown that machine learning (ML) can provide reasonable predictions faster and with higher flexibility compared to simulation crop modeling. However, a single machine learning model can be outperformed by a "committee" of models (machine learning ensembles) that can reduce prediction bias, variance, or both and is able to better capture the underlying distribution of the data. Yet, there are many aspects to be investigated with regard to prediction accuracy, time of the prediction, and scale. The earlier the prediction during the growing season the better, but this has not been thoroughly investigated as previous studies considered all data available to predict yields. This paper provides a machine leaning based framework to forecast corn yields in three US Corn Belt states (Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa) considering complete and partial in-season weather knowledge. Several ensemble models are designed using blocked sequential procedure to generate out-of-bag predictions. The forecasts are made in county-level scale and aggregated for agricultural district and state level scales. Results show that the proposed optimized weighted ensemble and the average ensemble are the most precise models with RRMSE of 9.5%. Stacked LASSO makes the least biased predictions (MBE of 53 kg/ha), while other ensemble models also outperformed the base learners in terms of bias. On the contrary, although random k-fold cross-validation is replaced by blocked sequential procedure, it is shown that stacked ensembles perform not as good as weighted ensemble models for time series data sets as they require the data to be non-IID to perform favorably. Comparing our proposed model forecasts with the literature demonstrates the acceptable performance of forecasts made by our proposed ensemble model. Results from the scenario of having partial in-season weather knowledge reveals that decent yield forecasts with RRMSE of 9.2% can be made as early as June 1(st). Moreover, it was shown that the proposed model performed better than individual models and benchmark ensembles at agricultural district and state-level scales as well as county-level scale. To find the marginal effect of each input feature on the forecasts made by the proposed ensemble model, a methodology is suggested that is the basis for finding feature importance for the ensemble model. The findings suggest that weather features corresponding to weather in weeks 18-24 (May 1(st)to June 1(st)) are the most important input features.

J	Hu, ZY; Hu, GP				Hu, Zhengyang; Hu, Guiping			Hybrid stochastic and robust optimization model for lot-sizing and scheduling problems under uncertainties	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Supply chain management; Stochastic programming; Robust optimization; Lot-sizing and scheduling; Automotive industry	CHAIN NETWORK DESIGN; PROGRAMMING MODEL; DEMAND; PRICE	Uncertainty is among the significant concerns in production scheduling. It has become increasingly important to take uncertainties into consideration for lot-sizing and scheduling. In this paper, we adopt the Hybrid Stochastic and Robust Optimization (HSRO) approach in lot-sizing and scheduling problems in which suppliers have the flexibility of satisfying a fraction of demand based on the market and their policies. Two types of uncertainties have been considered simultaneously: demand and overtime processing cost. Robust optimization is adopted for uncertain demand and Sample Average Approximation (SAA) technique is applied to solve the stochastic program for uncertain overtime processing cost. Numerical results based on a manufacturing company has been conducted to not only validate the proposed hybrid model but also quantitatively demonstrate the merit of our approach. Sample size stability test and sensitivity analyses on various parameters have also been conducted. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Maintenance and preservation methods such as overlays and sealers have been known to protect bridge decks from deterioration, while also extending a bridge's service life. It is important to understand the characteristics of various overlay types to make informed maintenance decisions, thus assessing and comparing the performance of thin epoxy overlays and low slump dense concrete (LSDC) overlays is desirable. To evaluate the performance of these two overlay types, the chloride resistance and long-term bond strength of the overlays were assessed. Three bridges were chosen to install each overlay type, with corresponding field and laboratory evaluations performed. The above tests results indicated that the initial bond strength of both overlays is good, but that the thin epoxy overlays showed decreased performance after 300 F/T cycles. The bond performance of the LSDC remain unchanged for the duration of the freeze-thaw testing, indicating superior long-term performance. As expected, the epoxy overlay performed much better than the LSDC overlay with respect to chloride resistance. These performance metrics are important to keep in mind when selecting maintenance and rehabilitation methods for bridges.

The Virtual Special Issues will highlight important topics and trends in the field by curating previously published articles that have contributed to defining important and influential issues, methods, and findings on the topics and trends. This Virtual Special Issue presents selected articles fromLanguage Testingon the topic of the consequences, also referred to as washback and impact, of language assessments and tests. The authors of the articles report their investigations of the social functions of tests in teaching and learning as well as in broader structures for attaining opportunities in society. In particular, the articles encompass the examples of social functions that Messick (1989) identified as potentially important in investigating the validity of test use. They also demonstrate a variety of research methods for the study of the consequences of language assessment use in a range of contexts. They vary in the extent to which they interpret results with respect to validity, but the more recent two articles engage explicitly with issues of consequences and validity. Regardless of the role assumed for consequences in validity arguments, these articles demonstrate the importance of investigating consequences in language testing and illustrate methods for doing so.

Some critical constraints to the realization of in vivo measurements include the necessity to fabricate the sensor on a tightly constrained footprint while ensuring acceptable biocompatibility, accuracy, and reliability. The inherent light-guiding properties of optical fibers over long distances, their microscopic cross-section that can be structured at the nanoscale to manipulate the light transmittance/reflectance spectrum, excellent biocompatibility enabling their efficient integration with biorecognition molecules, immunity to electromagnetic interference, mechanical flexibility, and low cost have been inviting research attention to utilize these unique features for in vivo and label-free point-of-care diagnostics. Hence, fiber-optic biosensing has become a promising research thrust, with a plethora of emerging methodologies to develop ultrasensitive and selective sensing probes. A unified presentation of the research trends on biosensors incorporated into optical fibers is presented.

The IL-SD method involves controled photodoping of silver (Ag) atoms into ChG films and selective removing of undoped ChG. For photodoping of Ag, an Ag-coated elastomer stamp is brought in contact with the ChG film and exposed to ultraviolet light, and subsequently, the Ag atoms are photo-dissolved into the ChG film following the nanopatterns on the elastomer stamp. Due to the high wet-etching selectivity of the undoped ChG to Ag-doped one, the ChG film can be precisely patterned with a spatial resolution on the order of a few tens of nanometers. Also, by controling the lateral diffusion of Ag atoms during ultraviolet exposure, it is possible to adjust the size of the final patterns formed in the ChG film. As an application demonstration of the IL-SD process, the As2S3-based near-infrared photonic crystals (PhCs) in the wavelength range and flexible midinfrared PhCs are formed, and their optical resonances are investigated. The IL-SD process enables the low-cost fabrication of ChG nanostructures on different substrate materials and gives a great promise to realize various IR devices.

Cold Stratification and Pericarp Removal Improve Seed Germination of Ptelea trifoliata and Ptelea crenulata	HORTSCIENCE			English	Article						dormancy; hoptree; polyethylene glycol; propagation; tetrazolium chloride; wafer ash	POLYETHYLENE-GLYCOL; SPECIALIZATION; LEPIDOPTERA; WATER	Two species of North American shrubs in the genus Ptelea (Rutaceae), commonly known as eastern and western hoptree or wafer ash, have unfulfilled potential to increase the diversity of managed landscapes and support populations of pollinators and swallowtail butterflies. The white flowers of Ptelea are highly fragrant, and pistillate flowers give rise to clusters of distinctive samaras. The insufficiency of information about improving germination of seeds of Ptelea trifoliata and lack of recommendations for Ptelea crenulata prompted us to investigate effects of pericarp removal and cold (4 degrees C) stratification periods of 0, 4, 8, and 16 weeks on the germination of seeds of these two species. Samaras were collected from multiple plants of both species in the midwestern United States (P. trifoliata) and California (P. crenulata). The germination percentage of viable seeds, calculated after tests of viability with tetrazolium chloride of seeds that did not germinate, increased with longer stratification periods, with 100% germination for P. crenulata and 91% germination for P. trifoliata after 16 weeks of stratification. The germination value, a measure of the speed and uniformity of germination, and peak value also increased with longer stratification in both species. Pericarp removal increased the germination percentage of both species and increased the peak and germination value of P. crenulata. Propagators seeking to grow these species of Ptelea from seed should remove the pericarp and cold-stratify seeds for 16 weeks to improve germination success.

We consider the special case when the mobile guards are restricted to move along the diagonals of a polygonal environment. First, we present an algorithm to identify candidate vertices in a polygon at which either static guards can be placed or they can serve as an endpoint of the segment on which mobile guards move. Next, we present a technique to partition the environment based on the triangulation of the environment, and allocate guards to each partition to track the intruder. The allocation strategy leads to a classification of the mobile guards based on their task and coordination requirements. Finally, we present a strategy to activate/deactivate static guards based on the speed of the intruder. Simulation results are presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed techniques.

Acute Heat Exposure Alters Autophagy Signaling in C2C12 Myotubes	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						heat; AMPK; autophagy; LC3; skeletal muscle	PROTEIN-TURNOVER; P38 MAPK; EXERCISE; STRESS; SHOCK; KINASE; HSP27; PHOSPHORYLATION; TEMPERATURES; ACTIVATION	Autophagy is a major intracellular degradation process that is essential for the clearance of unnecessary proteins/organelles and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The inhibition of autophagy results in cellular consequences associated with many skeletal muscle pathologies, and therapies designed to elevate autophagic activity may provide protection from such pathologies. Acute exposure to low levels of heat has therapeutic effects; however, the impact of heat on skeletal muscle autophagy remains unclear. In the present study, C2C12 myotubes were maintained at 37 degrees C thermoneutral (TN) or heated at 40 degrees C heat treatment (HT) for 1 h. Myotubes were harvested immediately after heating, or returned to 37 degrees C for recovery of 2 or 24 h. HT resulted in an elevation in pAMPK (T172), Beclin-1, and LC3 II, a marker for autophagosome formation, but no change in p62. In the context of autophagy inhibition with Bafilomycin A1, HT resulted in lower LC3 II compared to TN. The applied heat load induced the heat shock response, as evidenced by immee upregulation of HSF1 and Hsp70. Hsp70 continued to increase during recovery, whereas pHsp27 was downregulated acutely in response to HT, but retuned to TN levels by 2 h of recovery. HT also reduced the phosphorylation of the MAP-kinases p38 and JNK. These findings suggest that an acute, short bout of mild heat may be beneficial to skeletal muscle by increasing AMPK activity, markers of autophagasome formation, and the heat shock response.

The use of vegetation cover is one of the most cost-effective methods for soil erosion control, however, it does not provide long-term ground improvement since the method does not improve soil properties. The study presented in this paper explored the use of the bacterial enzyme induced calcite precipitation (BEICP) technique to reduce the erosion susceptibility of silty sandy soil. The BEICP technique was applied to the surface of sand specimens via a spraying method. The specimens were treated at four different enzyme concentrations (0 mg/mL-control, 0.3 mg/mL, 0.7 mg/ mL, and 1.5 m/mL) and tested for erosion susceptibility. The specimens were subjected to water erosion in a recirculating flume with mean flow velocity of 23.2 cm/s. The amount of soil erosion was measured via weight loss of the soil specimen. In addition, scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses were conducted on specimens. Results of the erosion tests demonstrated that the soils treated with high enzyme concentrations experienced almost no soil weight loss while the weight loss increased significantly (from 2.4% to 15.5%) with a decrease in enzyme concentrations. SEM analyses showed that top 2.54 cm (1-inch) layer of the soil specimen had the highest calcite precipitation formation than the lower level which could help to reduce the erosion susceptibility of the silty sand specimens. Overall, results of this study indicate that the BEICP technique has a potential act as an effective solution to reduce the erosion susceptibility sandy soils when applied through a spray application to the surface of the material.

Over the last decade, a few laboratory studies have reported soil stabilization with lignosulfonate, yet there has been very limited field practice to serve as application of the corresponding laboratory outcomes. In this field demonstration, diluted ammonium-based lignosulfonate was sprayed on a gravel road subgrade with the goal of improving the subgrade's strength and durability. In situ tests and documentation were conducted at different periods of the construction to monitor seasonal performance of the stabilized section and to draw lessons learned from the practice. Light-weight deflectometer (LWD) tests and the dynamic cone-penetration (DCP) tests were performed before, one week after, and six months after, the construction. The construction process was documented both visually and in written form. Some critical lessons learned from this demonstration provide recommendations for future studies and benefit relevant practitioners.

Developers update the code to fix the bugs in the system. How these code fixing techniques impacts the robustness of these systems has not been clear. Does fixing code increase the robustness? Do they deteriorate the learning capability of the DL based systems? To answer these questions, we studied 321 Stack Overflow posts based on a published dataset. In this study, we built a classification scheme to analyze how bug-fixes changed the robustness of the DL model and found that most of the bug-fixes can increase the robustness. We also found evidence of bug-fixing that decrease the robustness. Our preliminary result suggests that 12.5% and 2.4% of the bug-fixes in Stack Overflow posts caused the increase and the decrease of the robustness of DL models, respectively.

The active pharmaceutical ingredient, theophylline, was uploaded within the hydrogels prepared of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) K4M or E4M. The HPMC concentrations were adjusted to different levels (10 and 12% w/w) to fulfill the requirements for 3D printing. Rheological and textural properties, as well as release profiles, were significantly affected by the type and concentration of excipient regardless of theophylline doses used. The printing material should exhibit shear-thinning behavior, keeping yield stress less than 4000 Pa and a loss factor (tans = G ''/G') between 0.2 and 0.7, especially for 3D printing purposes using the current platform. The SEM images demonstrated that the hydrogel matrix exhibited a porous structure, which had the potential to encapsulate the theophylline clusters within its microstructure. The in vitro dissolution test showed that the release of all tablets was extended over 12 h, and the calculation of drug release kinetic models revealed that the 3D printed HPMC matrices release the theophylline by diffusion and erosion mechanisms. The excipient HPMC K4M 12% w/w hydrogel was optimal to load the theophylline with flexible dosage combinations due to the great extrudability and shape retention ability. The exploration of rheological properties was investigated in this study, and the results revealed that it is a feasible method to predict the SSE 3D printability and quality of hydrogel-API blend materials for the drug delivery system.

We report a paper-based sensor system for a point-of-care (POC) nucleic acid amplification test that can quantitatively detect multiple genes from different pathogens. The POC system combines a paper sensor chip and a portable instrument, which is built on an Internet of Things (IoT) platform. The paper-based sensor provides the functions of reagent storage, sample transportation, and nucleic acid amplification. The IoT instrument uses an Arduino microcontroller to control temperature, collect fluorescence images, and store the data in cloud storage via a WiFi network. A compact fluorescence reader was designed to measure fluorescence images of the amplicons during a loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction in real-time. The real-time detection capability enables the quantitative analysis of target genes. The results show that the paper-based sensor cam distinguish multiple genes of the genomic DNA extracted from Escherichia coli and Campylo-bacter jejuni, with the concentration as low as 2 x 10(3) copies/mu L. The affordable instrument, in conjunction with the disposable paper sensor chip, would have a great potential for POC detections of pathogens.

In this paper, we investigate the higher syzygies of I-G and give combinatorial descriptions of the Green-Lazarsfeld conditions N-p of toric edge ideals of bipartite graphs for all p >= 1. In particular, we show that I-G is linearly presented (i.e. satisfies condition N-2) if and only if the bipartite complement of G is a tree of diameter at most 3.

Pulses are a subgroup of legumes, harvested solely for dry grain seeds within a pod. Commonly consumed pulses include dry beans, dry peas, lentils, and chickpeas. Pulses are high in shortfall nutrients and could fill some nutritional gaps of college students. However, little is known about pulse intakes among young adults. The study aims were: (1) to identify knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding pulse consumption; and (2) to describe experiences of preparing dry pulses among college students. A convenience sample of 1433 students aged 18-30 enrolled at a Midwestern university in the United States completed an online survey in April 2020. Demographic and attitude variables were compared by the monthly count of pulse types eaten using chi-square, analysis of variance, and logistic regression modeling to predict pulse type intakes. Higher numbers of pulse types eaten was associated with being White, vegetarian/vegan, higher cooking self-efficacy, positive attitudes toward pulses, and greater daily intake of fruits, vegetables, and fiber. Knowledge and experience of cooking dry pulses was low, with canned pulses purchased more often. College students may not be consuming pulses due to unfamiliarity with them, low knowledge of nutrition benefits, and a general lack of cooking self-efficacy. Increased familiarization and promotion surrounding pulses may increase their consumption.

J	Cao, PY; Lu, CQ; Zhang, J; Khadilkar, A				Cao, Peiyu; Lu, Chaoqun; Zhang, Jien; Khadilkar, Avani			Northwestward cropland expansion and growing urea-based fertilizer use enhanced NH3 emission loss in the contiguous United States	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							NITROGEN-USE EFFICIENCY; AMMONIA EMISSIONS; NITRIFICATION INHIBITORS; LAND-USE; DEPOSITION; EARLIER; VOLATILIZATION; INVENTORY; IMPACT; CHINA	The increasing demands of food and biofuel have promoted cropland expansion and nitrogen (N) fertilizer enrichment in the United States over the past century. However, the role of such long-term human activities in influencing the spatiotemporal patterns of ammonia (NH3) emission remains poorly understood. Based on an empirical model and time-series gridded datasets including temperature, soil properties, N fertilizer management, and cropland distribution history, we have quantified monthly fertilizer-induced NH3 emission across the contiguous US from 1900 to 2015. Our results show that N-fertilizer-induced NH3 emission in the US has increased from < 50 Gg N yr(-1) before the 1960s to 641 Gg N yr(-1) in 2015, for which corn and spring wheat are the dominant contributors. Meanwhile, urea-based fertilizers gradually grew to the largest NH3 emitter and accounted for 78 % of the total increase during 1960-2015. The factorial contribution analysis indicates that the rising N fertilizer use rate dominated the NH3 emission increase since 1960, whereas the impacts of temperature, cropland distribution and rotation, and N fertilizer type varied among regions and over periods. Geospatial analysis reveals that the hot spots of NH3 emissions have shifted from the central US to the Northern Great Plains from 1960 to 2015. The increasing NH3 emissions in the Northern Great Plains have been found to closely correlate to the elevated NH4+ deposition in this region over the last 3 decades. This study shows that April, May, and June account for the majority of NH3 emission in a year. Interestingly, the peak emission month has shifted from May to April since the 1960s. Our results imply that the northwestward corn and spring wheat expansion and growing urea-based fertilizer uses have dramatically altered the spatial pattern and temporal dynamics of NH3 emission, impacting air pollution and public health in the US.

The long-standing extremal version of this problem focuses on the smallest number of leaves, mast(n), on which any two (binary and unrooted) phylogenetic trees with n leaves must agree. In this work, we prove that this number grows asymptotically as Theta(log n); thus closing the enduring gap between the lower and upper asymptotic bounds on mast(n).

The older plant gets the sun: Age-related changes inMiscanthus x giganteusphenology	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY			English	Review						aging; bioenergy; competitor-stress tolerance-ruderal (CSR) theory; growth dilution; morphological development; nitrogen dilution; nonlinear models; perennial grass; staggered-start design	BELOW-GROUND BIOMASS; MISCANTHUS GENOTYPES; SEASONAL DYNAMICS; NUTRIENT ACCUMULATION; NITROGEN ADDITION; COLD-TOLERANCE; GIANT REED; CROP; GROWTH; YIELD	Age-related changes are usually overlooked in perennial grass research; when they are considered it is usually as a change in plant size (e.g., biomass). Whether other physiological or developmental aspects change as stands age, and how those aspects may impact long-term stand dynamics, remains unclear. Conventional experimental designs study a single stand over multiple growing seasons and thereby confound age-related changes with growing season conditions. Here we used a staggered-start experimental design with three repeated planting years over two growing seasons to isolate growing season effects. We studied changes inMiscanthus x giganteusphenology during its yield-building stage (first 3 years) and estimated age, growing season and nitrogen (N) effects on development using nonlinear regression parameters. Stand age clearly changed plant growth; faster developmental rates were usually seen in 1-year-old stands (young), but because 2- and 3-year-old stands (mature) emerged 3 months earlier than newly planted stands they produced similar to 30% more stems with 30%-60% more leaves. Nitrogen fertilization modulated some age-related phenological changes. Fertilized 2-year-old stands reached similar stem densities as unfertilized 3-year-old stands and had fewer number of senesced leaves like 1-year-old stands. In addition, N fertilization had no effect on youngM. x giganteus, but extended mature stands' growing season more than 2 weeks by hastening emergence and delaying senescence. It also delayed flowering regardless of stand age. Our results suggest that, along with changes in size,M. x giganteusstands showed shifts in developmental strategies: young stands emerged later and developed faster, while mature stands grew for longer but more slowly. In temperate regions, where hard frost events are likely to interrupt development in late autumn, rapid early development is critical to plant survival. Nonlinear regression parameter differences proved effective in identifying phenological shifts.

Spatial Cognitive Implications of Teleporting Through Virtual Environments	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-APPLIED			English	Article						spatial cognition; navigation; triangle completion; teleporting; virtual reality	PATH-INTEGRATION; PLACE FIELDS; NAVIGATION; COMBINATION; ORIENTATION; POSITION; SYSTEMS; SENSES; INPUTS; TRAVEL	Teleporting is a popular interface to allow virtual reality users to explore environments that are larger than the available walking space. When teleporting, the user positions a marker in the virtual environment and is instantly transported without any self-motion cues. Five experiments were designed to evaluate the spatial cognitive consequences of teleporting and to identify environmental cues that could mitigate those costs. Participants performed a triangle completion task by traversing 2 outbound path legs before pointing to the unmarked path origin. Locomotion was accomplished via walking or 2 common implementations of the teleporting interface distinguished by the concordance between movement of the body and movement through the virtual environment. In the partially concordant teleporting interface, participants teleported to translate (change position) but turned the body to rotate. In the discordant teleporting interface, participants teleported to translate and rotate. Across all 5 experiments, discordant teleporting produced larger errors than partially concordant teleporting which produced larger errors than walking, reflecting the importance of translational and rotational self-motion cues. Furthermore, geometric boundaries (room walls or a fence) were necessary to mitigate the spatial cognitive costs associated with teleporting, and landmarks were helpful only in the context of a geometric boundary.

Capturing temporal heterogeneity in soil nitrous oxide fluxes with a robust and low-cost automated chamber apparatus	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							CARBON-ISOTOPE CONTENT; FREQUENCY MEASUREMENTS; FOREST SOILS; GAS FLUXES; N2O; EMISSIONS; DIOXIDE; DENITRIFICATION; RESPIRATION; FIELDS	Soils play an important role in Earth's climate system through their regulation of trace greenhouse gases. Despite decades of soil gas flux measurements using manual chamber methods, limited temporal coverage has led to high uncertainty in flux magnitude and variability, particularly during peak emission events. Automated chamber measurement systems can collect high-frequency (subdaily) measurements across various spatial scales but may be prohibitively expensive or incompatible with field conditions. Here we describe the construction and operational details for a robust, relatively inexpensive, and adaptable automated dynamic (steady-state) chamber measurement system modified from previously published methods, using relatively low cost analyzers to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The system was robust to intermittent flooding of chambers, long tubing runs (> 100 m), and operational temperature extremes (-12 to 39 degrees C) and was entirely powered by solar energy. Using data collected between 2017 and 2019 we tested the underlying principles of chamber operation and examined N2O did variation and rain-pulse timing that would be difficult to characterize using infrequent manual measurements. Stable steady-state flux dynamics were achieved during 29 min chamber closure periods at a relatively low flow rate (2 L min(-1)). Instrument performance and calculated fluxes were minimally impacted by variation in air temperature and water vapor. Measurements between 08:00 and 12:00 LT were closest to the daily mean N2O and CO2 emission. Afternoon fluxes (12:00-16:00 LT) were 28 % higher than the daily mean for N2O (4.04 vs. 3.15 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) and were 22 % higher for CO2 (4.38 vs. 3.60 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). High rates of N2O emission are frequently observed after precipitation. Following four discrete rainfall events, we found a 12-26 h delay before peak N2O flux, which would be difficult to capture with manual measurements. Our observation of substantial and variable diel trends and rapid but variable onset of high N2O emissions following rainfall supports the need for high-frequency measurements.

Diethylcarbamazine activates TRP channels including TRP-2 in filaria, Brugia malayi	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY			English	Article							ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS; ARACHIDONIC-ACID; METABOLISM; EMODEPSIDE; HETRAZAN; MODEL	Diethylcarbamazine is an important classic drug used for prevention and treatment of lymphatic filariasis and loiasis, diseases caused by filarial nematodes. Despite many studies, its site of action has not been established. Until now, the consensus has been that diethylcarbamazine works by activating host immune systems, not by a direct action on the parasites. Here we show that low concentrations of diethylcarbamazine have direct and rapid (<30s) temporary spastic paralyzing effects on the parasites that lasts around 4h, which is produced by diethylcarbamazine opening TRP channels in muscle of Brugia malayi involving TRP-2 (TRPC-like channel subunits). GON-2 and CED-11, TRPM-like channel subunits, also contributed to diethylcarbamazine responses. Opening of these TRP channels produces contraction and subsequent activation of calcium-dependent SLO-1K channels. Recovery from the temporary paralysis is consistent with inactivation of TRP channels. Our observations elucidate mechanisms for the rapid onset and short-lasting therapeutic actions of diethylcarbamazine. Verma et al. describe a new mechanism for diethylcarbamazine action, a drug classically used to treat lymphatic filariasis and loiasis. They propose that it induces rapid temporary spastic paralysis of parasites by opening TRP channels, including TRP-2 in muscle of Brugia malayi. Inactivation of TRP channels explain its short-lasting therapeutic activity.

It substantially influences energy consumption and saving. In the United States, residential and commercial buildings account for more than 70% of the total electrical energy consumed in the country. This paper explores the implementation of an online energy game, e-footprints, which aims to collect data about occupants' energy consumption and saving, and summarizes the feedback related to the first prototype of the user interface. The game was tested with 110 international students. The study focuses on the visualization, aesthetics, and usability of the e-footprints energy game, as these are the important elements of a player's interaction with the user interface and greatly influence the game play and the data that can be gathered. The paper concludes with a summary of the findings and general recommendations that may be useful for others using serious online urban planning games.

J	Moghadassian, B; Sharma, A				Moghadassian, Behnam; Sharma, Anupam			Designing wind turbine rotor blades to enhance energy capture in turbine arrays	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Inverse design; Wind farm design	MODEL; DYNAMICS; LINEARIZATION; MOMENTUM; CHORD; WAKES; FLOW	An inverse design approach is proposed to compute wind turbine blade geometries which maximize the aggregate power output from a wind farm. An iterative inverse algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. The algorithm seeks to minimize the target function, f = - C-P,C-av, where C-P,C-av is the average normalized mechanical power of all the turbines in the wind farm. An upper bound on the blade planform area, representative of the blade weight, is imposed to demonstrate how to incorporate constraints in the design process. The power coefficients (C-P) of the turbines in the farm are computed by solving the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations with the turbine rotors modeled as momentum sources using the actuator disk model. The inverse design is carried out using the trust-region-reflective method, which is a nonlinear least squares regression solver. The computation cost is reduced by computing the Jacobian once every few iterations and approximating it using Broyden's method in between. The proposed design approach is first demonstrated to maximize the isolated performance of single- and dual-rotor wind turbines and subsequently used to design the blades for a 3-turbine array and a ten-turbine array in which the downstream turbines operate directly in the wake of the upstream turbines. For a turbine-turbine spacing of four rotor diameters, the farm-optimized blade designs increase the farm power output by over five percent and the optimized blade geometries are found to be considerably different from the blade geometry optimized for isolated turbine operation. As the turbine-turbine spacing is increased to eight rotor diameters, the difference between the blade geometry optimized for farm operation versus that for isolated operation, is reduced.

In plants, it assists in responding to dynamic environmental conditions and maintaining metabolite homeostasis under normal or stress conditions. Under stress, autophagy is activated to remove damaged components and to recycle nutrients for survival, and the energy sensor kinases target of rapamycin (TOR) and SNF-related kinase 1 (SnRK1) are key to this activation. Here, we discuss accumulating evidence that hormone signaling plays critical roles in regulating autophagy and plant stress responses, although the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are often not clear. Several hormones have been shown to regulate TOR activity during stress, in turn controlling autophagy. Hormone signaling can also regulate autophagy gene expression, while, reciprocally, autophagy can regulate hormone synthesis and signaling pathways. We highlight how the interplay between major energy sensors, plant hormones, and autophagy under abiotic and biotic stress conditions can assist in plant stress tolerance.

Farmland Investment Characteristics from a Forward-Looking Perspective: An Explanation for the "High Return/Low Risk" Paradox	LAND ECONOMICS			English	Article							PRICES	Land values and cash rents are slow to adjust, and therefore the returns from owning farmland may be time varying and serially correlated. This article investigates a farmland portfolio's nominal and real returns from a forward-looking perspective, taking into account time-varying return and serial correlation. The results indicate that the attractive average return level observed historically can be attained only over a long investment period. The risk involved in the long investment period, however, is also substantial. As a result, in mixed-asset investment portfolios, the allocations to farmland are much lower than traditional mean-variance optimization implies.

Hagger (2019) recently reviewed this literature as it applies to the physical activity domain. The purpose of this article is to challenge these assumptions in favor of a habit conceptualization that is more applicable to physical activity: (1) behavioral instigation and/or execution can be habitual, allowing for variable responses to cues; (2) stable contexts can be internal or functional (cued by a preceding action) but may vary in timing and physical location; (3) a shift from external to internal goal dependence may characterize habit development; and (4) types of automaticity other than purely nonconscious enactment may characterize habitual action. I present theory and research that supports these alternative characterizations and discuss their ramifications for physical activity adoption and maintenance via habit.	[Phillips, L.

Prediction of crash risk is vital for avoiding secondary crashes and safeguarding highway traffic. For many years, researchers have explored several techniques for early and precise detection of crashes to aid in traffic incident management. With recent advancements in data collection techniques, abundant real-time traffic data is available for use. Big data infrastructure and machine learning algorithms can utilize this data to provide suitable solutions for the highway traffic safety system. This paper explores the feasibility of using deep learning models to detect crash occurrence and predict crash risk. Volume, Speed and Sensor Occupancy data collected from roadside radar sensors along Interstate 235 in Des Moines, IA is used for this study. This real-world traffic data is used to design feature set for the deep learning models for crash detection and crash risk prediction. The results show that a deep model has better crash detection performance and similar crash prediction performance than state of the art shallow models. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for crash risk prediction using data 1-minute, 5-minutes and 10-minutes prior to crash occurrence. It was observed that is hard to predict the crash risk of a traffic condition, 10 min prior to a crash.

Here, a microfluidic chip was developed for the fabrication of poly(ethylene glycol diacrylate) (PEGDA)-based hollow self-standing microvessels having inner dimensions ranging from 15 mu m to 73 mu m and displaying biocompatibility/cytocompatibility. Macromer solutions were hydrodynamically focused into a single microchannel to form a concentric flow regime, and were subsequently solidified through photopolymerization. This approach uniquely allowed the fabrication of hollow microvessels having a defined structure and integrity suitable for cell culturing.

Automated Methods Enable Direct Computation on Phenotypic Descriptions for Novel Candidate Gene Prediction	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						ontology; natural language processing; machine learning; semantic similarity; phenotype; phenologs	NATIONAL CENTER; ONTOLOGY; TOOL	Natural language descriptions of plant phenotypes are a rich source of information for genetics and genomics research. We computationally translated descriptions of plant phenotypes into structured representations that can be analyzed to identify biologically meaningful associations. These representations include the entity-quality (EQ) formalism, which uses terms from biological ontologies to represent phenotypes in a standardized, semantically rich format, as well as numerical vector representations generated using natural language processing (NLP) methods (such as the bag-of-words approach and document embedding). We compared resulting phenotype similarity measures to those derived from manually curated data to determine the performance of each method. Computationally derived EQ and vector representations were comparably successful in recapitulating biological truth to representations created through manual EQ statement curation. Moreover, NLP methods for generating vector representations of phenotypes are scalable to large quantities of text because they require no human input. These results indicate that it is now possible to computationally and automatically produce and populate large-scale information resources that enable researchers to query phenotypic descriptions directly.

Some of the forward-looking programs and faculty are bringing socio-technical perspectives to engineering education, but to- date they are not the majority. Though the students remain interested in technical content, oftentimes they face difficulty connecting what they learn to practicality. Consequently, students resort to learning through memorization and example-based learning implying that students quickly forget what they have learned. It is well documented that students can retain more about courses where they have participated in team activities, problem solving, etc. Since they can work on connections and sharing ideas as a community. In recent years, it is also becoming apparent that a lack of attention to human values and the human side of engineering will create disconnects between the social responsibility of engineers and their place as technical citizens and leaders. However, if a connection exists between the students' education and their personal learning goals, would there be an improvement in how they learn? Through our work, we seek evidence that when a student engages personally and is socio-technically aware they are more receptive to learning. We would like to know if incorporation of a human sided approach to engineering (through an inquiry classroom), enables engineering students to be more engaged and involved in their learning and eventually towards societal issues. Additionally, we will perform a content analysis of student reflections to investigate if an inquiry-based environment is suitable for students to engage in the human side of engineering.

Soybean yield and crop stage response to planting date and cultivar maturity in Iowa, USA	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							CLIMATIC VARIABILITY; SEEDING RATE; INDETERMINATE; VULNERABILITY; DETERMINATE; SYSTEMS	Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] planting date and maturity group are important agronomic decisions. This study quantified how maturity group selection and later than optimal planting dates affected grain yield and crop development across Iowa, USA. Field experiments were conducted in seven locations between 2014 and 2016. Cultivar maturities ranged from 2.2 to 3.7 maturity group and planting dates targeted for 20-d intervals from early May to early July. Soybean grain yield ranged from 0.27 to 7.54 Mg ha(-1). Cultivar maturity had little to no effect on grain yield at four of seven sites while planting date was significant at all sites (p < .001) and the planting date and cultivar maturity interaction was not significant. As planting date was delayed, the VE-R3 and R3-R7 periods were each shortened by up to 15-20 d. The shorter growing period resulted in less radiation and growing degree day accumulation. An exponential-plateau relationship between relative yield and GDD was evident for the VE-R3 phase, with a plateau at 700<degrees>C-d. A linear relationship between yield and GDD was evident from R3-R7, suggesting greater yield with more accumulated GDD. The opposite relationships were found for photoperiod which had a linear relationship for the VE-R3 and curvilinear for the R3-R7 phases. These results showed that yield potential would be maximized by planting before 20 May. We concluded that planting earlier in the spring was a better management practice than maturity selection to maximize yield and the R3-R7 period duration was critical in determining potential yield.

However, some issues still need to be addressed when using the RNN-based inversion model. First, with limited number of parameters in RNN, it cannot model the low-frequency dynamics accurately, thus an extra linear model has been used, which can become an interference for tracking control at high frequencies. Moreover, the control speed and the RNN modeling accuracy cannot be improved simultaneously as the control sampling speed is restricted by the length of the RNN training set. Therefore, this article focuses on addressing these limitations of RNN-based inversion model control. Specifically, a novel modeling method is proposed to incorporate the linear model in a way that it does not affect the existing high-requency control performance achieved by RNN. Additionally, an interpolation method is proposed to double the sampling frequency (compared to the RNN training sampling frequency). Analysis on the stability issues which may arise when the proposed new model is used for predictive control is presented along with the instructions on determining the parameters for ensuring the closed-loop stability. Finally, the proposed approach is demonstrated on a commercial piezo actuator, and the experiment results show that the tracking performances can be significantly improved.

This work reports the use of a plasmonic device as an efficient and low-cost PCR thermocycler to facilitate nucleic acid-based diagnosis. The thermoplasmonic device, consisting of a one-dimensional metal grating, exploited the strong light absorption of plasmonic resonance modes to heat up PCR reagents using a near-infrared laser source. The plasmonic device also integrated a thin-film thermocouple on the metal grating to monitor the sample temperature. The plasmonic thermocycler is capable of performing a PCR amplification cycle in ~2.5 minutes. We successfully demonstrated the multiplex and real-time PCR amplifications of the antibiotic resistance genes using the genomic DNAs extracted fromAcinetobacter baumannii,Klebsiella pneumonia,Escherichia coliandCampylobacter.

The study objectives were to explore women's qualitative perceptions of influences on their food choices such as food security, their knowledge of nutrition-related health risk factors and self-efficacy for diet change, and their dietary intakes in practice. Thirty-six women, aged 19-50, who were eligible to receive income-based assistance were recruited in central Iowa. Focus group discussions on defining healthy foods, influences on food choice, and nutrition information sources were analyzed using a socioecological model framework. Demographics, nutrient intake estimates, food security status, health behaviors, and self-efficacy for nutrition behavior change were collected by survey. Most participants were White (61%), single (69%), food insecure (69%), and living with children (67%). Few women met dietary recommendations. Barriers to healthy eating include cost, convenience/preparation time, family taste preferences, and limitations of federal food assistance programs. Facilitators are high self-efficacy for nutrition change and health knowledge on average. These results challenge the strategy of using nutrition education to improve healthy eating and instead show that intervention messaging should focus on limited, achievable steps to improve dietary choices that fit within cost, convenience, and taste constraints.

The evolution of electrochemical behavior of API X70 pipeline steel during active dissolution in 1 M NaHCO3 was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Electrochemical modeling of EIS revealed that the metal dissolution rate is limited by slow inward diffusion of CO3-2 ions through a porous precipitated corrosion product layer to the steel surface. The porosity of the carbonate layer decreases over time as its thickness increases, both factors contributing to a strongly suppressed corrosion rate due to impeded CO3-2 diffusion. Decreasing steel corrosion rates with time in carbonate-bicarbonate solutions can be understood on this basis. Growth of the carbonate layer at the steel-carbonate interface intensifies tensile wedging stress in corroded grain boundaries, thereby facilitating intergranular crack initiation.

The animals were presented as weak, lethargic, and some with high fever. Rapidly escalating mortality was reported to be as high as 30-50% within groups at the buying station over 8-10 d, and 30-40% over 5-7 d at the abattoir. Splenomegaly and red lymph nodes were the most consistent macroscopic findings, with scant fibrinous polyserositis observed in one sow. The microscopic lesions of vasculitis, fibrin thrombi, fibrinosuppurative polyserositis, and intralesional bacteria were consistent with acute bacterial septicemia. Bacterial culture isolatedStreptococcus equisubsp.zooepidemicus(S. zooepidemicus) from multiple organs, including spleen, lung, and kidney. PCR tests were negative for African swine fever virus, classical swine fever virus,Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine circovirus 2, andSalmonellaspp. Porcine circovirus 3 was inconsistently detected at low levels by PCR, with a lack of associated lesions. Next-generation sequencing identifiedS. zooepidemicusand porcine partetravirus in the serum sample of the feeder pig from the buying station. Phylogenetic analysis of theszPgene indicated that theS. zooepidemicusisolates from Ohio and Tennessee are in genotype VI. We conclude that the cause of these high mortality events in swine wasS. zooepidemicussepticemia.

This paper reviewed laboratory test results of various sands at different fabric directions. Based on the observations, this paper formulates the hypothesis that deposit plane creates a plane of weakness and the anisotropic strength of sands depends on orientations of deposit plane and failure plane. The strength decreases when orientations of deposit plane and failure plane are close to each other, and the strength increase when they diverge from each other. Then, an anisotropic failure criterion is developed based on this hypothesis and validated by available experimental data from literature. Remarkable agreements between predictions and measurements have been observed, which demonstrate validity, effectiveness, and robustness of new criterion in characterizing anisotropic strength of sands with variations of loading directions and intermediate principal stresses.

J	Schimpf, DW; Peters, FE				Schimpf, Daniel Wilhelm; Peters, Frank Earl			Variogram Roughness Method for Casting Surface Characterization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF METALCASTING			English	Article						variogram roughness; surface roughness; abnormalities; metalcasting		Casting surface specifications are set based on aesthetics, functionality, or a combination of both. To classify casting surfaces, visual inspections are performed by an operator who compares the casting surface to pictures or comparator plates (e.g., metal, plastic) that represent a certain roughness level. This inspection process is highly subjective, and disagreements arise on the acceptance of a casting between the casting producer and buyer. To minimize these disagreements and use developments in 3D scanning, this study aims to develop a digital surface characterization method. The method developed and implemented in this study utilizes underlying geometry estimation, abnormality detection, and a new roughness characterization formula based on a variogram to determine a surface roughness value. Tests were done to compare the new roughness characterization formula with existing quantification methods (i.e., Sa, Sq) and to compare the results of the method with human operators. The tests indicated that the variogram roughness was able to differentiate between the roughness levels of the current surface roughness standards GAR-C9 and SCRATA. In addition, the results are repeatable as well as reproducible and agree with operator judgment based on a ranking comparison between the operator and the digital method. Overall, the digital surface roughness method has the potential to improve the communication between casting suppliers and designers and make the surface roughness classification more reliable and repeatable.

Material Selection for the Joint between Adjacent Box Beams	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Adjacent-box-beam bridges; Finite-element modeling; Early-age shrinkage-compensated concrete; Joint cracking	CONCRETE	Bridges constructed with adjacent precast concrete box beams have been in service for many years. A recurring problem with this type of bridge is cracking in the longitudinal joints between adjacent beams. Many research results have indicated that efficient joint material should have small or zero shrinkage at an early age and achieve sufficient bond strength at the interface between the joint and the box beam. As the first part of a comprehensive study, two phases of material properties tests were conducted to select the best material for the joint between adjacent box beams to resist cracking. During Phase I work, four potential joint materials were tested and evaluated based on shrinkage, flexural tensile strength, and normal bond strength. During Phase II work, time-dependent material testing was conducted on the materials selected from Phase I to characterize the nonlinear changes in bond, compressive, and tensile strength with time. In addition, three-dimensional (3D) finite-element models (FEMs) were developed to calculate the early-age joint stress distribution and evaluate the structural performance of a Type IV joint grouted with epoxy grout and a Type V joint filled with shrinkage-compensated concrete. A finite-element modeling approach that is capable of simulating early-age joint behavior was illustrated, and models were developed for beam-joint-beam structures that were 1.2 m (4 ft) long. The analytical results indicated that a Type V joint filled with shrinkage-compensated concrete is expected to better resist joint cracking than a Type IV joint filled with epoxy. Although the FEM results indicated that a Type V joint filled with shrinkage-compensated concrete still induces tensile stress near the exterior of the interface, placing reinforcement near the edge will provide sufficient capacity to resist debonding at the interface during the early-age period when initial cracking has been found to occur.

To make reliable and sustainable transmission expansion plans, numerous sources of uncertainty including demand, generation capacity, and fuel cost must be taken into consideration in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This paper presents a new approach to selecting a small number of high-quality scenarios for transmission expansion. The Kantorovich distance of social welfare distributions was used to assess the quality of the selected scenarios. A case study was conducted on a power system model that represents the U.S. Eastern and Western Interconnections, and ten high-quality scenarios out of a total of one million were selected for two transmission plans. Results suggested that scenarios selected using the proposed algorithm were able to provide a much more accurate estimation of the value of transmission plans than other scenario selection algorithms in the literature.

Such quizzes can engage retrieval practice, thereby improving learning and retention. However, despite their potential benefits, recent work suggests that students typically underutilize online practice quizzes. This article reports an observational classroom study, in which students were provided optional online reviews throughout the semester. The reviews could be accessed in test format, in which students were given multiple-choice questions and provided correct answer feedback, or in read format in which students were given the same questions and were shown the correct answers. Students who used the test format performed better on exams than students who used the read format or did not use the reviews. Nevertheless, the massive majority of the online reviews (approximately 88%) were not completed, highlighting the tendency for students to underutilize optional online reviews.

However, the vast majority of archived data remain unused. Here, we present MetaOmGraph (MOG), a free, open-source, standalone software for exploratory analysis of massive datasets. Researchers, without coding, can interactively visualize and evaluate data in the context of its metadata, honing-in on groups of samples or genes based on attributes such as expression values, statistical associations, metadata terms and ontology annotations. Interaction with data is easy via interactive visualizations such as line charts, box plots, scatter plots, histograms and volcano plots. Statistical analyses include co-expression analysis, differential expression analysis and differential correlation analysis, with significance tests. Researchers can send data subsets to R for additional analyses. Multithreading and indexing enable efficient big data analysis. A researcher can create new MOG projects from any numerical data; or explore an existing MOG project. MOG projects, with history of explorations, can be saved and shared. We illustrate MOG by case studies of large curated datasets from human cancer RNA-Seq, where we identify novel putative biomarker genes in different tumors, and microarray and metabolomics data from Arabidopsis thaliana.

Computer vision and machine learning enabled soybean root phenotyping pipeline	PLANT METHODS			English	Article						RSA; Root; Phenotyping; Phenomics; Computer vision; Machine learning; Breeding; Soybean; Time series; Image analysis	ORYZA-SATIVA L.; MAIZE ZEA-MAYS; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE; GENOTYPIC VARIATION; GENETIC-VARIABILITY; GROWTH; RICE; SOIL; FIELD	Background Root system architecture (RSA) traits are of interest for breeding selection; however, measurement of these traits is difficult, resource intensive, and results in large variability. The advent of computer vision and machine learning (ML) enabled trait extraction and measurement has renewed interest in utilizing RSA traits for genetic enhancement to develop more robust and resilient crop cultivars. We developed a mobile, low-cost, and high-resolution root phenotyping system composed of an imaging platform with computer vision and ML based segmentation approach to establish a seamless end-to-end pipeline - from obtaining large quantities of root samples through image based trait processing and analysis. Results This high throughput phenotyping system, which has the capacity to handle hundreds to thousands of plants, integrates time series image capture coupled with automated image processing that uses optical character recognition (OCR) to identify seedlings via barcode, followed by robust segmentation integrating convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) method prior to feature extraction. The pipeline includes an updated and customized version of the Automatic Root Imaging Analysis (ARIA) root phenotyping software. Using this system, we studied diverse soybean accessions from a wide geographical distribution and report genetic variability for RSA traits, including root shape, length, number, mass, and angle. Conclusions This system provides a high-throughput, cost effective, non-destructive methodology that delivers biologically relevant time-series data on root growth and development for phenomics, genomics, and plant breeding applications. This phenotyping platform is designed to quantify root traits and rank genotypes in a common environment thereby serving as a selection tool for use in plant breeding. Root phenotyping platforms and image based phenotyping are essential to mirror the current focus on shoot phenotyping in breeding efforts.

Optimizing the microstructure can lead to higher photo current generation, and is an active area of experimental research. There has been recent progress in framing OSC microstructure design as a computational design problem. However, most current approaches to microstructure optimization are based on volumetric distribution of material, which makes the design space very large. In contrast, we frame the microstructure design optimization problem in terms of designing the interface between the donor and acceptor regions, and thus pose it as a surface representation and optimization problem. This results in substantially reduced number of design variables, thus enabling use of standard optimization tools. In this work, we address the efficient design of OSC microstructure by using surface and curve modeling techniques to model the donor-acceptor interface, and use meta-heuristic, gradient-free optimization techniques to optimize the microstructure for maximum short circuit current generation. Our modeling framework consists of three major components: (1) geometric modeling of OSC microstructure that uses Non-Uniform Rational B-spline (NURBS) curves and surfaces to construct the free-form donor-acceptor interface, (2) photo-current generation modeling that uses a parallel, finite-element based exciton-drift-diffusion (XDD) model, and (3) optimization that utilizes genetic algorithms (GA) to optimize the OSCs microstructure via exploration of the NURBS representation. We apply these methods for the optimization of both 2D and 3D microstructures. Results show substantial improvement in current density compared to the bulk-heterojunction microstructures. These results provide promising microstructures for experimental groups to fabricate. The proposed surface representation approach seems to be a promising approach for interface design in engineered systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We determine the total detection error probability (sum of false alarm and missed detection probability), the adversary's optimum detection strategy that minimizes the total detection error probability, and the communicator's optimum message hiding strategy that maximizes the total detection error probability. Additionally, we explore exploiting the channel variations to further increase the total detection error probability. We show that the total detection error probability increases and converges to 1 as the number of users increases and that the total detection error probability can be increased by increasing the transmission power when the channel variation is exploited.

However, due to the rapid brittle breakage of particles, the failure mechanisms are not well observed. Remarkable advances in the high-speed imaging technique facilitate to observe the rapid and dynamic process of the particle breakage. This paper presents a novel testing system consisting of a single particle uniaxial loading frame and a high-speed video camera. The high-speed camera captures the rapid crack initiation and propagation process in gravel particles under uniaxial compression. A digital image correlation technique (DIC) is used to analyze captured video to determine displacement and strain fields during fracture initiation and propagation processes of gravel particles. This research verifies the feasibility of using highspeed imaging and DIC techniques to analyze particle breakage processes.

Toward "Smart Canopy" Sorghum: Discovery of the Genetic Control of Leaf Angle Across Layers	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; GRAIN-SORGHUM; PLANT-DENSITY; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; ERECT LEAVES; ORYZA-SATIVA; MAIZE; YIELD; PHOTOSYNTHESIS	Leaf angle across the sorghum canopy is genetically controlled by both common and layer-specific loci, which holds potential for the development of an optimized canopy associated with higher yields. A "smart canopy" ideotype has been proposed with leaves being upright at the top and more horizontal toward the bottom of the plant to maximize light interception and conversion efficiencies, and thus increasing yield. The genetic control of leaf angle has, to date, been studied on one or two leaves, or data have been merged from multiple leaves to generate average values. This approach has limited our understanding of the diversity of leaf angles across layers and their genetic control. Genome-wide association studies and quantitative trait loci mapping studies in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) were performed using layer-specific angle data collected manually and via high-throughput phenotyping strategies. The observed distribution of angles in indoor and field settings is opposite to the ideotype. Several genomic regions were associated with leaf angle within layers or across the canopy. The expression of the brassinosteroid-related transcription factor BZR1/BES1 and the auxin-transporter Dwarf3 were found to be highly correlated with the distribution of angles at different layers. The application of a brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor could not revert the undesirable overall angle distribution. These discoveries demonstrate that the exploitation of layer-specific quantitative trait loci/genes will be instrumental to reversing the natural angle distribution in sorghum according to the "smart canopy" ideotype.

Estimating Soybean Radiation Use Efficiency Using a UAV in Iowa	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						RUE; UAV; reflectance; foliar fungicides; frogeye leaf spot	EMPIRICAL LINE METHOD; DRY-MATTER PRODUCTION; LEAF-AREA INDEX; SEED YIELD; RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION; GENETIC-IMPROVEMENT; FIELD CONDITIONS; ACCUMULATION; PRODUCTIVITY; REMOVAL	Radiation use efficiency (RUE) is difficult to estimate and unreasonable to perform on a small plot scale using traditional techniques. However, the increased availability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provides the ability to collect spatial and temporal data at high resolution and frequency, which has made a potential workaround. An experiment was completed in Iowa to (i) demonstrate RUE estimation of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] from reflectance data derived from consumer-grade UAV imagery and (ii) investigate the impact of foliar fungicides on RUE in Iowa. Some fungicides are promoted to have plant health benefits beyond disease protection, and changes in RUE may capture their effect. Frogeye leaf spot severity did not exceed 2%. RUE values ranged from 0.98 to 1.07 and 0.96 to 1.12 across the entire season and the period post-fungicide application, respectively, and fell within the range of previously published soybean RUE values. Plots treated with fluxapyroxad + pyraclostrobin had more canopy cover (p = 0.078) compared to the non-treated control 133 days after planting (DAP), but yields did not differ. A "greening effect" was detected at the end of the sample collection. RUE estimation using UAV imagery can be considered a viable option for the evaluation of management techniques on a small plot scale. Since it is directly related to yield, RUE could be an appropriate parameter to elucidate the impact of plant diseases and other stresses on yield.

J	Karakaya, K				Karakaya, Kadir			Design considerations in emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic: a human-centered approach	ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Design; Emergency remote teaching; ERT; Design process; Student-centered; Humanizing pedagogy; Pedagogy of care		This paper is in response to the article entitled "The process of designing for learning: understanding university teachers' design work" (Bennett et al., Educ Tech Res Dev 65:125-145, 2017). Bennett et al. (Educ Tech Res Dev 65:125-145) present a descriptive model of the design process that reports findings from a qualitative study investigating the design processes of 30 instructors from 16 Australian universities through semi-structured interviews. This exploratory study provides rich, contextualized descriptions about university teachers' design process and pinpoints key design characteristics as top-down, breadth-first, iterative, responsive, and reflective. These key design characteristics revealed by the rich contextual descriptions could provide applicable insights into the design process especially for new instructors. The findings of the study could inform how learning design could be adapted during an emergency remote teaching (ERT) as it is dynamic and open to revision. A noteworthy limitation of the study is that complementary data such as design artifacts could be utilized to ensure data triangulation in addition to self-reported data obtained via interviews. The study found that university instructors' design process did not appear to draw on instructional design models. Therefore, future studies could focus on to what extent and how such models could be used by university instructors. Lastly, future studies may explore how technology is used in ERT design to support their needs. In this article, I share how design can be informed by humanizing pedagogy and pedagogy of care during ERT.

SMA is mostly caused by low levels of Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein due to deletion of or mutation in the SMN1 gene. Its nearly identical copy, SMN2, fails to compensate for the loss of SMN1 due to predominant skipping of exon 7. Correction of SMN2 exon 7 splicing by an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), nusinersen (Spinraza (TM)), that targets the intronic splicing silencer N1 (ISS-N1) became the first approved therapy for SMA. Restoration of SMN levels using gene therapy was the next. Very recently, an orally deliverable small molecule, risdiplam (Evrysdi (TM)), became the third approved therapy for SMA. Here we discuss how these therapies are positioned to meet the needs of the broad phenotypic spectrum of SMA patients.

Pre-transit vitamin C injection improves post-transit performance of beef steers	ANIMAL			English	Article						antioxidants; cattle; feedlot; oxidative stress; transportation	BOVINE RESPIRATORY-DISEASE; ASCORBIC-ACID; ROAD TRANSPORTATION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CALVES; PLASMA; HAPTOGLOBIN; CATTLE	Although cattle can synthesize vitamin C (VC) endogenously, stress may increase VC requirements above the biosynthetic threshold and warrant supplementation. This study investigated the effects of a VC injection delivered before or after a long-distance transit event on blood parameters and feedlot performance of beef steers. Fifty-two days prior to trial initiation, 90 newly weaned, Angus-based steers from a single source were transported to Ames, IA, USA. On day 0, 72 steers (356 +/- 17 kg) were blocked by BW and randomly assigned to intramuscular injection treatments (24 steers/treatment): saline injection pre- and post-transit (CON), VC (Vet One, Boise, ID, USA; 5 g sodium ascorbate/steer) injection pre-transit and saline injection post-transit (PRE) or saline injection pre-transit and VC injection post-transit (POST). Following pre-transit treatment injections, steers were transported on a commercial livestock trailer for approximately 18 h (1675 km). Post-transit (day 1), steers were sorted into pens with one GrowSafe bunk/pen (4 pens/treatment; 6 steers/pen). Steers were weighed on day 0, 1, 7, 30, 31, 56 and 57. Blood was collected from 3 steers/pen on day 0, 1, 2 and 7; liver biopsies were performed on the same 3 steers/pen on day 2. Data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design (experimental unit = steer; fixed effects = treatment and block) and blood parameters were analyzed as repeated measures. A pre-transit VC injection improved steer average daily gain from day 7 to 31 (P= 0.05) and overall (day 1 to 57;P= 0.02), resulting in greater BW for PRE-steers on day 30/31 (P= 0.03) and a tendency for greater final BW (day 56/57;P= 0.07). Steers that received VC pre- or post-transit had greater DM intake from day 31 to 57 (P= 0.01) and overall (P= 0.02)v. CON-steers. Plasma ascorbate concentrations were greatest for PRE-steers on day 1 and POST-steers on day 2 (treatment x day;P< 0.01). No interaction or treatment effects were observed for other blood parameters (P >= 0.21). Plasma ferric-reducing antioxidant potential and malondialdehyde concentrations decreased post-transit (day;P< 0.01), while serum non-esterified fatty acids and haptoglobin concentrations increased post-transit (day;P< 0.01). In general, blood parameters returned to pre-transit values by day 7. Pre-transit administration of injectable VC to beef steers mitigated the decline in plasma ascorbate concentrations and resulted in superior feedlot performance compared to post-transit administration.

However, recent behavioral studies and meta-analyses reporting failed replications have called into question whether or not bilingualism leads to changes in domain-general executive functions. The present paper argues that there are several reasons, often overlooked, that lead to failed replications, and that when group differences do appear on EF tasks, despite these issues, performance favors bilinguals far more often than monolinguals. The present paper reports a Bayesian analysis of 167 independent studies to support this claim with a Bayes Factor classified as "decisive" evidence for the alternative (BF10=2.91x10(8)), ruling out chance outcomes that would predict an equal number of studies favoring monolinguals to studies favoring bilinguals. These findings could not be explained by publication bias, year of publication, or sample size. Critically, these findings are not at odds with recent meta-analyses examining overall effect sizes, but rather, highlight the need to determine when, rather than if, bilinguals outperform monolinguals on EF tasks.

J	Bagheri, H; Severin, AJ; Rajan, H				Bagheri, Hamid; Severin, Andrew J.; Rajan, Hridesh			Detecting and correcting misclassified sequences in the large-scale public databases	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article								Motivation: As the cost of sequencing decreases, the amount of data being deposited into public repositories is increasing rapidly. Public databases rely on the user to provide metadata for each submission that is prone to user error. Unfortunately, most public databases, such as non-redundant (NR), rely on user input and do not have methods for identifying errors in the provided metadata, leading to the potential for error propagation. Previous research on a small subset of the NR database analyzed misclassification based on sequence similarity. To the best of our knowledge, the amount of misclassification in the entire database has not been quantified. We propose a heuristic method to detect potentially misclassified taxonomic assignments in the NR database. We applied a curation technique and quality control to find the most probable taxonomic assignment. Our method incorporates provenance and frequency of each annotation from manually and computationally created databases and clustering information at 95% similarity. Results: We found more than two million potentially taxonomically misclassified proteins in the NR database. Using simulated data, we show a high precision of 97% and a recall of 87% for detecting taxonomically misclassified proteins. The proposed approach and findings could also be applied to other databases.

Due to the complex nature of cloud-IoT ecosystems, there is a growing concern about data utility at the cost of privacy. While the current state-of-the-art encryption schemes protect users' privacy, they preclude meaningful computations on encrypted data. Thus, the question remains "how can IoT device users benefit from cloud computing without worrying about privacy and security?" Cloud service providers (CSPs) can leverage fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes to build privacy-preserving services. However, there are challenges in adopting them for cloud-IoT devices. Thus, to foster real-world adoption of FHE-based solutions, we propose a framework called proxy reciphering as a service. We leverage schemes, such as distributed servers, secret sharing, FHE, and chameleon hash functions to tailor a solution that enables long-term privacy-preserving computations for encrypted IoT-device data and is secure even after a device-key compromise. We evaluate the framework by developing a testbed and measuring the latencies with real-world ECG records from TELE ECG database. We also analyze the security properties against major cyber threats. We observe that: 1) the computation and communication latencies are acceptable, and the security gains outweigh the latencies introduced; 2) the throughput of the reciphering proxy servers can be increased with preprocessing; and 3) a key-refresh scheme can limit the postcompromise attack exposure window. We infer that proxy reciphering as a service is a practical, secure, scalable and an easy-to-adopt framework for long-term privacy-preserving cloud computations for cloud-IoT applications.

Characterization and Patterns of Engineering and Technology Student Leadership Domains	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SCIENCE	This research investigated the Clifton StrengthsFinder leadership domains of engineering and technology students in an engineering department within a large, Midwestern, research-intensive, land-grant university to characterize groups in the department by their leadership domains. In the department; students are taught about strengths early in their program to help them better understand how to utilize their unique talents to be successful but limited analysis of these data has occurred. The purpose of this research was to analyze the student strengths data to identify potential patterns of leadership domains among the students. The previous three years of student strengths data were collected and analyzed to identify differences between gender and type of major (technology or engineering) in the department. The number of strengths in each domain and the frequency of dominant domains were analyzed for each group of gender and major. Previous research suggests that there should be no patterns of strengths or best set of strengths for specific majors or based on gender. This research has identified multiple patterns of leadership domains among the different groups in the department. The leadership domain Executing was the most frequently occurring dominant domain across all groups in the department except for technology major females. Technology female students had the most prevalent dominant leadership domain of Relationship building. This analysis serves as a foundation for future longitudinal research examining similarities and differences over time.

However, performing utility-scale segmentation for unobservable customers with only monthly billing information, remains a challenging problem. To address this challenge, we propose a new metric, the coincident monthly peak contribution (CMPC), that quantifies the contribution of individual customers to system peak demand. Furthermore, a novel multi-state machine learning-based segmentation method is developed that estimates CMPC for customers without smart meters (SMs): first, a clustering technique is used to build a databank containing typical daily load patterns in different seasons using the SM data of observable customers. Next, to associate unobservable customers with the discovered typical load profiles, a classification approach is leveraged to compute the likelihood of daily consumption patterns for different unobservable households. In the third stage, a weighted clusterwise regression (WCR) model is utilized to estimate the CMPC of unobservable customers using their monthly billing data and the outcomes of the classification module. The proposed segmentation methodology has been tested and verified using real utility data.

SOM's Computer Group: Narratives of women in early architectural computing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL COMPUTING			English	Article; Early Access						History of architectural computing; gender equality; SOM Computer Group; women in architecture		Cultural narratives of digital technology in architecture rely heavily upon stories of unique, almost always male, genius and often deny the collective intellectual labor of technology's construction. These narratives are perpetuated by a historical record which does not fully address the contributions of women to the history of digital technology. Because this history is not well-documented, there is an opportunity to represent these events in a manner which is more inclusive and equitable. Toward that end, this article focuses on narratives from the SOM Computing Group (1964-1990), as a means of correcting the historical record and addressing gender equity in the profession. The interviews collected here highlight several women who helped to integrate technologies into architecture through professional experimentation and cross-disciplinary collaboration. While it is not a comprehensive history, this work represents the beginning of an agenda to produce a history of technology in architecture which better reflects the contributions of women to the digital designs of today.

Determination of U-bolt connection load capacities in overhead sign support structures	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH			English	Article						Finite element modeling; Highway sign trusses; Overhead sign supports; U-bolt load capacity	FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; SINGLE-BOLT; JOINTS	The load capacities of the U-bolt connections used in steel overhead sign trusses for the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) are not known because the bolts are used in ways that do not match available manufacturer data. Although these U-bolt connections appear to have performed satisfactorily in the past, there has been a growing safety concern in recent years because of the need for overhead sign trusses to support larger signs with greater span lengths. The objective of this project is to develop effective and efficient methodologies to realistically estimate the capacity of the U-bolt connections specified in the actual Steel Overhead Sign Truss (SOST) design standards. To achieve this objective, a literature search on the utilization and modeling techniques for U-bolt connections was first conducted. Three laboratory tests were then performed on two types of specimens with loading directions of 0 degrees and 90 degrees for the Type-A specimen and 0 degrees for the Type-B specimen. The data collected from the tests were used to calibrate finite element models (FEM). Finally, the calibrated models were then used in a parametric study to calculate the yield and ultimate capacity of both types of specimens with various material properties and load resultant directions.

J	Tsai, LW; Alipour, A				Tsai, Li-Wei; Alipour, Alice			Assessment of fatigue life and reliability of high-mast luminaire structures	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH			English	Article								Recent failures of high-mast luminaire poles have showcased the vulnerability of such structures to wind loading. High mast luminaire poles are long slender structures with low damping and highly susceptible to wind-induced vibrations that over a large number of cycles can result in fatigue failures during the life cycle of the structure. Such poles are constructed from sets of components that include base plate, reinforced cut-out hand holes, weld details and a hollow tubular pole supporting the luminaire. Among all these components, the base-to-tube connection was identified to have the lowest fatigue resistance through static analysis and previous fatigue experiments, so this study focuses on estimating the fatigue life of the base-to-tube connection under wind loading. Wind time histories were generated for different mean wind speeds and used to analyze fatigue performance in terms of stress cycle, failure, and damage indices. Simulated results were collected to build a damage fraction function to show the fatigue damage created in a certain period at different mean wind speeds. Local wind probability data was combined with the fatigue damage fraction function to estimate the fatigue life at different locations. Also, reliability analysis was carried out through running Monte Carlo simulations. The results provide a general framework for helping designers and fabricators to better determine the fatigue life and probability of failure of high-mast luminaire poles. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Holme, T				Holme, Thomas			Using the chemistry of pharmaceuticals to introduce sustainable chemistry and systems thinking in general chemistry	SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACY			English	Article						Systems thinking; Curriculum development; Sustainability; Rich context; General chemistry	MOLECULAR-BASIS; EDUCATION	Introductory college chemistry courses are required by a wide range of science curricula. This fact has tended to frame the courses as places where core, fundamental ideas are taught, so that a foundation of knowledge might be called upon by students when they are in subsequent courses. Unfortunately, the preponderance of com- partmentalized fundamental topics bolsters learning that has challenges in terms of transfer of knowledge to other science settings. One method that has been proposed to help alleviate this concern is to incorporate systems thinking and rich contexts that directly connect foundational chemistry ideas to larger systems. One area that shows strong potential for such efforts is the science of pharmaceuticals. Adding examples related to the chemistry of drugs, both within the large lecture setting of general chemistry and within smaller discussion groups. The role of example problems, student writing projects and group construction of systems thinking related visualizations of the context of pharmaceutical chemistry are reported.

J	Park, S; Carriquiry, A				Park, Soyoung; Carriquiry, Alicia			A database of two-dimensional images of footwear outsole impressions	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article; Data Paper						Shoeprints; Image analysis; Pattern evidence; Forensic science; Statistics		Footwear outsole images were obtained from 150 pairs of used shoes. The motivation for constructing the database was to enable a statistical analysis of two-dimensional (2D) images of shoe outsoles, to understand within shoe (between replicate images of the same shoe) and between shoe variability, and to develop methods for the evaluation of forensic pattern evidence of shoeprints. Since we scanned the outsole of the used shoes, the images capture not only the outsole pattern design but also the marks that arise from wear and tear and that may help identify the shoe that made the impression. Each shoe in a pair was scanned five times, so that replicate images can be used to estimate within-shoe variability. In total, there are 1500 2D images in the database. The EverOS footwear scanner was used to capture the outsole of each shoe. The scanner detects the weight distribution of the person wearing the shoe when he or she steps on the scanning surface. It images the portions of the outsole that make contact with the scanning surface. The database is a useful resource for forensic scientists or for anybody else with an interest in image comparison. The database we describe, was constructed by researchers in the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence (CSAFE) at Iowa State University. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

J	Low, MC				Low, Michael Christopher			Desert Dreams of Drinking the Sea, Consumed by the Cold War: Transnational Flows of Desalination and Energy from the Pacific to the Persian Gulf	ENVIRONMENT AND HISTORY			English	Article						Desalination; energy; nuclear power; oil; technopolitics; water	WATER; TECHNOPOLITICS; TECHNOLOGY; HISTORY; STATE	During the Cold War, from the early 1950s through the 1970s, the US Office of Saline Water was instrumental in spearheading the basic research and development that incubated the desalting techniques we see today. American technical assistance programs were fundamental to the growth of desalination capacity in the Middle East and its eventual globalisation. However, the federal government's original target for desalination was southern California and the arid Southwest. Desalination was proposed as the emergency backstop in the event that California's unquenchable thirst would inevitably overtax the dams of the Colorado River. And yet. American desalination never fully came to fruition. Instead, the promise of domestic desalination was co-opted and cannibalised by Cold War foreign policy. This essay traces how the Office of Saline Water's domestic desalination plans were repackaged and exported to Israel and Saudi Arabia. This essay considers how and why the United States slipped from the vanguard of desalination research while the Middle East emerged as its global leader. By connecting and comparing the divergent experiences of the American West and the Middle East, it also sheds new light on the nexus between the production of desalinated water and its key ingredient, energy.

Direct Photorelease of Alcohols from Boron-Alkylated BODIPY Photocages	JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PHOTOREMOVABLE PROTECTING GROUPS; LIGHT	BODIPY photocages allow the release of substrates using visible light irradiation. They have the drawback of requiring reasonably good leaving groups for photorelease. Photorelease of alcohols is often accomplished by attachment with carbonate linkages, which upon photorelease liberate CO2 and generate the alcohol. Here, we show that boron-alkylated BODIPY photocages are capable of directly photoreleasing both aliphatic alcohols and phenols upon irradiation via photocleavage of ether linkages. Direct photorelease of a hydroxycoumarin dye was demonstrated in living HeLa cells.

Comparison of multiple single-use, pulse-dose trace mineral products provided as injectable, oral drench, oral paste, or bolus on circulating and liver trace mineral concentrations of beef steers	APPLIED ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						copper; manganese; selenium; zinc; cattle	SELENIUM SUPPLEMENTATION; COPPER; MANGANESE; INJECTION; PERFORMANCE; METABOLISM; ENZYME; CATTLE; SHEEP	Objective: The objective was to determine effects of various trace mineral products on steer plasma and liver trace mineral concentrations. Materials and Methods: Fifty-six trace mineral adequate Angus-cross steers (303 +/- 15.2 kg; n = 8 per treatment) were sorted by BW and administered treatments on d 0: injectable saline (CON), injectable Multi-min90 (ITM), Mineral Max Drench (MMD), Mineral Max Paste (MMP), Starting Fluid Drench (SFD), Se365 bolus (Se365), or Reloader250 bolus (Rel250). Steers received a common diet (silage-based diet d 0-49; corn-based diet d 50-122), and individual feed disappearance was recorded. Plasma (0, 8, 24, and 48 h) and liver (-7, 2, 15, 29, 49, 65, 91, and 120 d) were analyzed for Cu, Mn, Se, and Zn. Results and Discussion: Plasma Zn, Mn, and Se concentrations were affected by treatment x time (P = 0.001); steers given ITM had greater concentrations through 8 h for Zn and 24 h for Mn and Se versus other treatments. Liver Se concentration was greater in ITM versus other treatments through d 15, but Rel250 was greater than ITM and MMP on d 91 and greater than CON, MMD, MMP, and SFD on d 120 (treatment x time; P = 0.001). Liver Mn, Zn, and Cu were affected by time (P = 0.001), where liver Mn concentrations were least on d 2 and increased over time but liver Zn concentrations were greatest on d 2 and least on d 29 to 120. Implications and Applications: Single-use, pulse-dose products increased circulating trace minerals most quickly as an injection (increasing plasma Mn, Se, Zn) compared with other treatments, whereas liver Se concentrations were increased by injection (through d 29) and Rel250 (by d 91).

The spread of the virus all over the world sent billions of people into lockdown. In light of rising concerns, a growing number of universities across the globe and specifically in the United States have either postponed or canceled all campus events such as workshops. conferences, sports, and other activities. Universities took intensive measures to prevent and protect all students, faculty, and staff members from the highly infectious disease. This resulted in migrating all face-to-face courses into an online course. In this paper, the authors present the impact of COVID-19 on migrating a Team-based Learning C programming course from face-to-face to online delivery and its effect on student learning. The results section of this paper shows that the student learning curve was affected significantly by the sudden online delivery of the course.

This paper addresses the limitation by proposing, implementing, and evaluating a practical and efficient solution based on a game theoretic approach. The solution defines a template of heavy-duty smart contract (HDSC); recruits only a small number of executors to execute heavy-duty tasks; employs a game theoretic scheme to enforce economically-rational executors to individually or collectively perform the execution correctly. Extensive game theoretic analysis has been conducted to show the security and computational efficiency of the solution even in face of collusion among the executors. As a proof of concept, the proposed solution has been implemented and experimented to demonstrate its practicality and compatibility with Ethereum.

A novel environmental enrichment device increased physical activity and walking distance in broilers	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						broiler; environmental enrichment; well-being; lameness; behavior	DOMESTIC CHICKS; BEHAVIOR; FOOD; FEAR; PERFORMANCE; LAMENESS; PREFERENCES; FEARFULNESS; VALIDATION; COMPLEXITY	Modern broilers are selected for fast growth and a large proportion of breast tissue, contributing to a top-heavy phenotype, leg disorders, and inactivity as birds reach market weight. Therefore, the objective was to motivate broilers to move through environmental enrichment. A total of 1,200 Ross 308 broilers were housed in pens of 30 for 6 wk: 600 birds were exposed to a novel laser enrichment device (LASER) and 600 were control. Each device projected 2 randomly moving red laser dots onto the floor 4 times/day for 4-min "laser periods." Seven LASER and 7 control pens, with 5 focal birds/pen (n = 70), were randomly selected to be video-recorded day 0 to 8 and once weekly for the remainder of the trial. Videos were analyzed to measure broiler time-budget and behaviors such as latency to feed and distance walked during laser periods. Focal birds were gait scored weekly on-farm. A test of the human-approach paradigm was carried out on weeks 1 and 6 on all pens. LASER birds were more active on days 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, moving 254% more on day 7 (P <= 0.05). Time spent active was increased in LASER treatment by 114% on week 2; 157% on week 3; 90% on week 4; and 82% on week 5. LASER birds spent more time at the feeder on days 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and on weeks 1 and 5, with 84% more time at feeder than control on day 5 (P < 0.05). LASER birds walked further during laser periods on day 0 to 8, reaching 646.5 cm greater (day 1), and on weeks 2, 3, 4, and 5, with an increase of 367.5 cm on week 2 (P <= 0.05). Over week 1 to 6, 60.54 +/- 7.4% of focal birds in the laser treatment were at the feeder during or within 5 min following laser periods. The laser enrichment device was successful in stimulating broiler physical activity and feeding, and did not negatively impact walking ability.

This is part of a larger effort to redesign core courses in the sophomore and junior years through a collaborative instructional model and pedagogical approaches that promote professional formation. A required sophomore course on embedded computer systems has been assessed and revised over multiple semesters. The redesign of the project was initiated with the purpose of promoting student professional formation, interest, autonomy and innovation, and it was undertaken using a collaborative process. This paper describes the course, final project, redesign process, assessment, results and future work. Several conclusions from the research may be useful to other educators. A small change to the course project yielded positive effects in interest and autonomy and may influence longer term effects of the project. There was evidence of difference in engagement with the project. The difference observed was not only due to option selected by students but why students selected the option.

These cracks suddenly appeared within 0.60 m to 1.20 m from widened slab edges and could be detrimental to the long-term pavement performance. The primary objective of this study was to identify possible causes for such longitudinal cracking observed on widened concrete pavements. Both field investigation and Finite Element Analysis were performed. Degrees of curling and warping were measured using a Terrestrial Laser Scanner. Concrete cores were also extracted to achieve a better understanding of how the cracking had developed. Field survey and numerical simulation results indicate that such longitudinal cracks could be primarily caused by a combination of excessive traffic loads, a high degree of curling and warping, inadequate support from underlying layers, pavement ageing, and skewed joints. It was also found that 4.30 m widened slabs coupled with tied Portland Cement Concrete shoulders outperformed others in terms of producing less cracking, even when they had experienced higher levels of truck traffic. The sites constructed in late afternoons also showed significantly less longitudinal cracks.

J	Wang, Y				Wang, Yan			Sub-Gaussian and subexponential fluctuation-response inequalities	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article								Sub-Gaussian and subexponential distributions are introduced and applied to study the fluctuation-response relation out of equilibrium. A bound on the difference in expected values of an arbitrary sub-Gaussian or subexponential physical quantity is established in terms of its sub-Gaussian or subexponential norm. Based on that, we find that the entropy difference between two states is bounded by the energy fluctuation in these states. Moreover, we obtain generalized versions of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation in different regimes. Operational issues concerning the application of our results in an experimental setting are also addressed, and nonasymptotic bounds on the errors incurred by using the sample mean instead of the expected value in our fluctuation-response inequalities are derived.

J	Geneson, J				Geneson, Jesse			Metric dimension and pattern avoidance in graphs	DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Metric dimension; Edge metric dimension; Pattern avoidance; Extremal problems		In this paper, we prove a number of results about pattern avoidance in graphs with bounded metric dimension or edge metric dimension. We show that the maximum possible number of edges in a graph of diameter D and edge metric dimension k is at most (left perpendicular2D/3 right perpendicaular + 1)(k) + k Sigma(inverted right perpendicular D/3 inverted left perpendicular)(i=1) (2i)(k-1), sharpening the bound of ((k)(2)) +kD(k-1) + D-k from Zubrilina (2018). We also show that the maximum value of n for which some graph of metric dimension <= k contains the complete graph k(n) as a subgraph is n = 2(k). We prove that the maximum value of n for which some graph of metric dimension <= k contains the complete bipartite graph k(n,n) as a subgraph is 2(Theta(k)). Furthermore, we show that the maximum value of n for which some graph of edge metric dimension <= k contains K-1,K-n as a subgraph is n = 2 k. We also show that the maximum value of n for which some graph of metric dimension <= k contains K1-n as a subgraph is 3(k) - O(k). In addition, we prove that the d-dimensional grids Pi P-d(i-1)ri, have edge metric dimension at most d. This generalizes two results of Kelenc et al. (2016), that nonpath grids have edge metric dimension 2 and that d-dimensional hypercubes have edge metric dimension at most d. We also provide a characterization of n-vertex graphs with edge metric dimension n - 2, answering a question of Zubrilina. As a result of this characterization, we prove that any connected n-vertex graph G such that edim(G) = n - 2 has diameter at most 5. More generally, we prove that any connected n-vertex graph with edge metric dimension n - k has diameter at most 3k - 1. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Whole Egg Consumption Decreases Cumulative Weight Gain in Diet-Induced Obese Rats	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION			English	Article						whole egg; egg consumption; diet-induced obesity; rat; weight gain	TYPE-2; BREAKFAST; LIPIDS	Background: Whole egg (WE) consumption has been demonstrated to attenuate body weight (BW) gain and adiposity in genetic animal models of type 2 diabetes (T2D). This finding was accompanied by increased food consumption. Objectives: This study aimed to examine the effects of long-term WE intake on BW gain, fat distribution, and food intake in a rat model of diet-induced obesity (DIO). Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 24) were obtained at 5 wk of age and were randomly weight-matched across 1 of 4 dietary intervention groups (6 rats per group): a casein-based diet (CAS), a high-fat high-sucrose CAS diet (HFHS CAS), a whole egg-based diet (EGG), or a high-fat high-sucrose EGG diet (HFHS EGG). All diets provided 20% (w/w) protein and were provided for 33 wk. HFHS diets provided similar to 61% of kilocalories from fat and 10% from sucrose. Daily weight gain and food intake were recorded, biochemical parameters were measured via ELISA, and epididymal fat pad weights were recorded at the end of the study. Results: At 33 wk, cumulative BW gain in DIO rats fed HFHS EGG resulted in 23% lower weight gain compared with DIO rats fed HFHS CAS (P < 0.0001), but no significant differences in BW gain were observed between the HFHS EGG group and the control EGG and CAS groups (P = 0.71 and P = 0.61, respectively). Relative food intake (grams per kilogram BW) was 23% lower (P < 0.0001) in rats fed HFHS CAS compared with CAS, whereas there was no difference in food intake within the EGG dietary groups. DIO rats fed HFHS EGG exhibited a 22% decrease in epididymal fat weight compared with their counterparts fed the HFHS CAS. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that consumption of a WE-based diet reduced BW gain and visceral fat in the DIO rat, similar to our previous findings in a genetic rat model with T2D.

Development of High RAP-High Performance Thin-Lift Overlay Mix Design Using a Soybean Oil-Derived Rejuvenator	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fine-graded reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP); Biorejuvenator; Thinlay; Low-temperature fracture; Rutting; Fatigue performance	EPOXIDATION	A laboratory study was conducted to develop a thin-lift overlay (Thinlay) mix design containing a polymer-modified PG58-34E+ binder with a 3.5% add to the mix, and 40% fine reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) that would meet the criteria for the State of Iowa using a bioderived rejuvenator called sub-epoxidized soybean oil (SESO). Two groups of binder and mix specimens were created for this investigation: (1) a control with no SESO, and (2) a rejuvenated group with 0.28% SESO by total mix weight (4.88% by total binder content-RAP binder + PG58-34E+), where the binder groups were evaluated using the multiple stress creep recovery (MSCR) test and bending beam rheometer (BBR), while the mix groups were evaluated using rutting, low-temperature, and fatigue performance tests. Binder results showed that the optimal dosage of SESO must be higher than 8% to achieve a PG46-46E+ to account for RAP inclusion in the mix design. Binder performance had a significant effect on low-temperature mix and fatigue performance, while rutting performance was found to be acceptable for the rejuvenated group.

J	Leslie, T				Leslie, Thomas			Chicago's Other Skyscrapers: Grain Elevators and the City, 1838-1957	JOURNAL OF URBAN HISTORY			English	Article; Early Access						agricultural history; construction history; finance; transportation; Chicago		More than one hundred major structures for warehousing grain were built in Chicago between the city's founding decade and the 1960s. These were vital to the city's status as a transportation and financial capital as they provided the impetus for Chicago's commodities market and enabled smooth transfer to points east by rail or ship. The city's grain elevators also served as markers of changing economic geography, as precincts developed throughout the city that related to railroad development, river and lake access, and commercial pressures. Chicago's decline as a grain market in the late twentieth century is reflected in their abandonment. While elevator structures in Buffalo and Montreal have attracted attention from architectural and urban historians, those in Chicago have been largely ignored, but they show how construction, infrastructure, politics, labor, and trade were uniquely enmeshed with one another due to that city's position within in networks of rail and water transportation.

Effects of an F18 enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli challenge on growth performance, immunological status, and gastrointestinal structure of weaned pigs and the potential protective effect of direct-fed microbial blends	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						direct-fed microbials; E. coli; immune response; intestinal barrier; probiotics; swine	INTESTINAL BARRIER FUNCTION; EXPRESSION; DIARRHEA; PIGLETS; K88; PROBIOTICS; RESPONSES; IMMUNITY; STRAINS; FEVER	The objective of this experiment was to investigate the impact of an F18 enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) challenge on growth performance, aspects of intestinal function, and selected immune responses of piglets, as well as to evaluate potential protective effects of direct-fed microbial (DFM) blends. Seventy-two weaned piglets (6.4 +/- 0.2 kg body weight [BW]; similar to 21 d of age) were assigned to one of four treatments: 1) NC: Nonchallenged (n = 10), 2) positive challenged control (PC): F18 ETEC-challenged (n = 10), 3) PC + DFM1 (n = 8; three strains of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; 7.5 x 10(5) colony-forming units [cfu]/g), or 4) PC + DFM2 (n=8; 2 strains of B. amyloliquefaciens and one strain of Bacillus subtilis; 1.5 x 10(5) cfu/g). Feed intake and BW were recorded on day 0, 7, and 17. Pigs were sham-infected either with 6 mL phosphate-buffered saline or inoculated with 6 mL F18 ETEC (similar to 1.9 x 10(9) cfu/mL) on day 7 (0 d postinoculation [dpi]). All ETEC-challenged pigs were confirmed to be genetically susceptible to F18. Pigs had ad libitum access to feed and water throughout the 17-d trial. Fecal scores were visually ranked and rectal temperatures were recorded daily. To evaluate ETEC shedding, fecal swabs were collected on dpi 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10. Blood samples were collected on dpi 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10. Ileal tissues were collected at necropsy on dpi 10. All challenged treatments had lower final BW, decreased average daily gain (ADG), and average daily feed intake (ADFI) during the 10-d postchallenge period (P < 0.01). The DFM2 treatment increased E. coli shedding on dpi 2 and decreased iton dpi 7 (P < 0.05) compared with the PC. Rectal temperature decreased across all challenged treatments (P < 0.01). Ileal mRNA abundance of occludin (OCLN) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) decreased in PC and DFM1 compared with NC (P < 0.05). Pigs fed DFM2 had intermediate ileal mRNA abundance of OCLN and increased ZO-1 mRNA compared with pigs in PC (P < 0.05). Interleukin 8 (IL-8) increased in the plasma of PC and DFM2 on dpi 2 compared with NC (P < 0.05). Mucosal IL-8 increased in PC compared with NC (P < 0.05). All challenged treatments tended to have elevated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA abundance compared with NC (P < 0.10). Challenged pigs had reduced secretory immunoglobulin A and villus height compared with NC pigs (P < 0.05). The impact of an ETEC challenge on intestinal function and the immune system has been revealed, information critical to developing improved treatment regimes.

J	Suzuki, Y				Suzuki, Yoshinori			Impact of material convergence on last-mile distribution in humanitarian logistics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Disasters; Humanitarian logistics; Material convergence; Vehicle routing; Simulation	DISASTER RESPONSE; RELIEF; OPERATIONS; ECONOMIES	Material convergence (MC) in humanitarian logistics refers to the movement of relief supplies from donor sites to distribution centers in disaster areas, from which the final deliveries are made to survivors (last-mile distribution). We investigate how the choice of MC strategy (approach) affects the effectiveness of last-mile distribution. Specifically, we investigate the relative performance of the two frequently used MC approaches in terms of their ability to facilitate (propel) effective last-mile distribution. These two approaches are: (1) p-method (in which the most-urgent material always flows into disaster areas first) and (2) m-method (in which every shipment bound to disaster areas is comprised of a mix of urgent and less-urgent materials). We first analyze advantages and disadvantages of each approach from the theory perspective, and then perform numerical experiments to examine the specific conditions under which each approach performs most, or least, effectively. Results indicate that, in 83.3% of cases, the m-method (less widely used approach in practice) works more effectively than the p-method (more widely used approach).

Computational study of buoyancy driven turbulence in statistically homogeneous bubbly flows	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Two-fluid model; Reynolds stress model; Buoyancy driven turbulence; Turbulence characteristics	GAS-LIQUID FLOW; LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; CFD SIMULATION; 2-FLUID MODEL; TRANSVERSE MIGRATION; KINETIC-ENERGY; COLUMN FLOWS; LIFT FORCE; DYNAMICS	Buoyancy driven turbulence due to heterogeneous bubble swarms are typically encountered in bubble columns operating in the dense heterogeneous regime. The integral scales of such turbulence are much larger than single bubble produced pseudo-turbulence. Accurate computational fluid dynamics predictions in this regime require correctly formulated anisotropic turbulence models with closures accounting for buoyancy driven turbulence effects. In the current study, a Reynolds-stress transport equation is formulated for bubbly flows from a hyperbolic two-fluid model by Reynolds averaging. The unclosed terms generated due to Reynolds averaging are quantified using high grid resolution, two-fluid simulations for bubbly flows in a periodic domain. The relative importance of the unclosed terms are discussed from a modeling stand point. The turbulence statistics, length and time scales, energy spectra, mean momentum budget and the Reynolds stress budget are analyzed for different bubble void fractions. The results show that the unclosed terms generated due to the averaging of Drag is significant in the liquid phase Reynolds Stress budget. Moreover, the unclosed terms generated due to the averaging of Drag, Virtual mass and Buoyancy are significant in the gas phase Reynolds Stress budget. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effect of lactose and a prototype Lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product on digestibility, nitrogen balance, and intestinal function of weaned pigs	TRANSLATIONAL ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						intestinal enzymes; intestinal morphology; intestinal permeability; nursery pigs; weaning stress	FATTY-ACID CONCENTRATIONS; LOW FEED-INTAKE; NUTRIENT DIGESTIBILITY; BARRIER FUNCTION; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; ENERGY-INTAKE; EXPRESSION; CELLS; MILK; MORPHOLOGY	The objective of this study was to determine the effects of lactose (LA) and a prototype Lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product (FP) on growth performance, diet digestibility, nitrogen (N) balance, and intestinal function of weaned pigs. Twenty-eight newly weaned pigs [approximately 21 d of age; initial body weight (BW) = 5.20 +/- 0.15 kg] were housed in metabolism crates and assigned to one of four treatments (n = seven pigs per treatment) corresponding to a 2 x 2 factorial design: with (LA+; 15% inclusion) or without (LA-) LA and with (FP+) or without (FP-) the prototype FP (1 g of FP per kilogram of diet; Diamond V, Cedar Rapids, IA). Feed and water were provided ad libitum. At day 5, pigs were orally given lactulose and mannitol to assess small intestinal permeability. Fecal samples were collected on days 5-9 to determine the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter (DM), gross energy (GE), and N. Total urine output and fecal samples were collected on days 10-13 to determine N retention. On day 15, all pigs were euthanized to collect intestinal lumen and tissue samples. Data were analyzed for the main effects of LA and FP and their interaction using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Lactose improved average daily feed intake (ADFI; P = 0.017), the ATTD of DM (P = 0.014), the ATTD of GE (P = 0.028), and N retention (P = 0.043) and tended to increase the butyric acid concentration in the colon (P = 0.062). The FP tended to increase the digestibility of N (P = 0.090). Neither LA nor the FP affected intestinal barrier function or inflammation markers. The interaction between LA and FP affected intestinal morphology: in the jejunum, pigs fed LA+FP- had increased villus height compared with those fed LA+FP+ and LA-FP-, whereas LA+FP+ was intermediate (interaction P = 0.034). At the terminal ileum, pigs fed LA-FP+ and LA+FP- had increased villus height and villus: crypt compared with those fed LA-FP-, whereas LA+FP+ was intermediate (interaction P = 0.007 and P = 0.007, respectively). In conclusion, the addition of LA brings important nutritional attributes to nursery diets by improving feed intake, digestibility of DM and GE, and the N retention of weaned pigs; however, the functional capacity of LA to improve markers of intestinal function is limited. On the other hand, the FP showed only a mild increase in the digestibility of N but a limited capacity to improve markers of intestinal function.

Improvement of our understanding of this relationship requires identifying and explaining the mechanisms that allow transformational CEOs to mobilise employees towards an active support of innovation. We argue that top managers who portray a transformational leadership style have a positive effect on organisational innovation by improving how the firm exchanges and communicates information and knowledge, that is, by increasing employees' participation and social capital. Data from a sample of 194 executives from 97 Ecuadorian small- and medium-sized firms provide support for our hypotheses.

Identifying when crops reach specific growth stages can improve harvest yield prediction and quantify climate change. Using the Level 2 vegetation optical depth (VOD) product from the European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite, we retrospectively estimate the timing of a key crop development stage in the United States Corn Belt. We employ nonlinear curves nested within a hierarchical modeling framework to extract the timing of the third reproductive development stage of corn (R3) as well as other new agronomic signals from SMOS VOD. We compare our estimates of the timing of R3 to United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) survey data for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013. We find that 87%, 70%, and 37%, respectively, of our model estimates of R3 timing agree with USDA district-level observations. We postulate that since the satellite estimates can be directly linked to a physiological state (the maximum amount of plant water, or water contained within plant tissue per ground area) it is more accurate than the USDA data which is based upon visual observations from roadways. Consequently, SMOS VOD could be used to replace, at a finer resolution than the district-level USDA reports, the R3 data that has not been reported by the USDA since 2013. We hypothesize the other model parameters contain new information about soil and crop management and crop productivity that are not routinely collected by any federal or state agency in the Corn Belt.

Such discrepancies undercut spatial models of politics. Rightward leaners' tendency to use different, more self-anchored, bases for assessing ideology may make them especially likely to dissent in this way, as might their attention to distinct issues. Results from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems confirm that those on the political right are likelier to reverse typical left-right orderings, even on right-leaning or major parties. Evidence from the Dutch Parliamentary Election Study further shows that right-leaners' nonstandard ordering extends to parties' specific issue-positions-particularly, notably, on issues of higher salience to the left. Standard models of politics may accordingly apply less well to those who identify as being on the political right.

Land use optimization for nutrient reduction under stochastic precipitation rates	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Land use optimization; Stochastic programming; Nutrient reduction	MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; POLLUTION-CONTROL; ROTATION; TILLAGE; CORN; CONSERVATION; SUPPORT	A nutrient reduction strategy for Iowa identifies land use and conservation alternatives to reduce nutrient loss from agriculture and the resulting Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. From the viewpoint of a policy maker concerned with regional costs and benefits, we develop a land use optimization model to maximize profit while satisfying nutrient reduction constraints. Because uncertain precipitation levels affect both yields and nutrient loss, we formulate two variants of a multistage stochastic mixed-integer program with probabilistic scenarios for annual precipitation generated from a Markov chain model. Numerical sensitivity analyses on the recourse variant reveal complicated interactions among the nutrient reduction and labor availability constraints as well as crop prices. The chance-constrained variant provides needed flexibility in meeting nutrient reduction goals by neglecting low-probability precipitation outcomes. Case study results indicate that, although significant financial incentives might be required for landowners to implement optimal strategies, substantial reductions in nutrient loss can be achieved.

Identification of measures predictive of age of puberty onset in gilts	TRANSLATIONAL ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						follicle development; gilt development; puberty	REPRODUCTIVE-PERFORMANCE; BODY-COMPOSITION; PRODUCTIVE LIFE; 1ST; GROWTH; LENGTH; ESTRUS; ATTAINMENT; WEIGHT	A potential indicator of female lifetime productivity in swine is age of puberty, when a gilt achieves her first behavioral estrus. Follicular activity, as determined by tertiary follicle development, in prepubertal gilts begins during postnatal day (PND) 75 to 115. The central hypothesis of this study is that gilts demonstrating tertiary follicle development earlier in life, assessed using vulva size as a proxy, achieve puberty earlier in life compared with counterparts of a similar age and weight that lack tertiary follicle development. The objectives of this project were to identify a developmental time point when variation in ovarian development exists and to determine whether a relationship between the age prepubertal ovarian development and the age at onset of puberty exists. To accomplish this, 155 gilts of similar age (+/- 2 d) were weighed and vulva size measured on PND 75, 85, 95, 105, and 115. Vulva measures, including vulva width (VW), vulva length (VL), and vulva area (VA), were utilized as developmental proxies for follicular activity. At each time point, gilts (n = 10) were sacrificed and ovarian follicular activity recorded. In a subset of gilts (n = 105), estrus detection was conducted daily on PND days 126 to 200. Mean VA on PND 75, 85, 95,105, and 115 was 596 +/- 206, 683 +/- 190, 864 +/- 212, 1014 +/- 228, and 1265 +/- 252 mm 2 , respectively. Of the gilts demonstrating behavioral estrus, 28 were within PND 140 to 160, 36 between PND 161 to 180, 15 between PND 181 to 200, and 26 did not demonstrate estrus behavior within 200 d of age. All gilts euthanized at PND 75 lacked follicular activity as defined by having a minimum of 2 antral follicles per ovary, whereas 60%, 80%, 90%, and 100% demonstrated follicular activity on PND 85, 95, 105, and 115, respectively. Body weight at PND 75 and VW at PND 115 were correlated to age at first estrus (P < 0.05). Of the gilts whose VA was less than 1 SD from the mean on PND 95 (i.e., <652 mm(2)), 31% and 50% demonstrated their first behavioral estrus by PND 180 and 200, respectively. However, of gilts whose VA was within or greater than 1 SD of the mean (i.e., >= 652 mm(2)), 66% and 79% exhibited estrus prior to PND 180 and 200, respectively. These data support utilization of VA changes between 95 and 115 d of age as a useful tool to identify replacement gilts prior to puberty for inclusion into the sow herd.

We show this very natural conjecture is true when the exponent is at least 2 or when the space is finite-dimensional. However, we also show there is no uniform solution even when given upper and lower bounds on the exponent. The proof of this result leads to some basic results on the effective theory of stable random variables.

Our proposed histogram generation mechanism reduces memory and logic resources by storing the time difference between consecutive events, instead of the absolute time of each event. Additionally, we explore the trade-off between system resource usage and histogram accuracy as a function of the precision at which time is encoded. Our results show that across three event-based camera benchmarks we can reduce the encoding of time from 32 to 7 bits with a loss of only approximately 3% in histogram accuracy. In comparison to a software implementation, our architecture shows a significant speedup.

Farmers who apply a foliar fungicide to manage leaf diseases have also observed reduced lodging. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of a foliar fungicide applied at silking on percent lodging. Field trials were established on Iowa State University Research Farms in 2016 and 2017. Treatments evaluated were foliar fungicide application (with or without) and harvest date (corn harvested at weekly intervals for up to 5 weeks); a split plot design was used with four complete blocks. Across all locations and years, a fungicide application significantly reduced mean lodging (P < 0.0001) by 9.3% and increased yields (P = 0.0043) by an average of 258.3 kg/ha (4.1 bu/acre). Percent lodging increased as harvest was delayed (P < 0.0001). This study demonstrated that foliar fungicides applied at silking reduced lodging and thus confirmed observations of farmers. Applying a fungicide to reduce lodging and favor harvest, however, is not recommended due to risk of fungicide resistance development and the lack of efficacy on stalk rot pathogens.

However, it remains unknown if GTS can be effectively delivered through telemedicine. Methods: Participants with PD from rural areas were recruited to complete a prerecorded GTS program, once a week for 8 weeks. Voice and respiratory outcome measures were collected 1 week before and 1 week after intervention. Results: Ten participants were enrolled in the study. One participant dropped at week 3. Five participants attended all eight sessions, two participants completed seven sessions, and one participant completed six sessions for 93.75% compliance. Statistical analysis for the data collected from the eight participants enrolled in the study revealed that voice outcome measures improved but did not reach significance. However, respiratory outcome measures significantly improved. Discussion: Results suggest that prerecorded GTS is feasible. Moreover, results are in keeping with results from a previous study using the exact same intervention with an in person therapist. Thus, this pilot work suggests that the use of prerecorded GTS may be a viable treatment option for those with limited access to care.

Under the symmetric assumption of the stochastic gradient distribution, we show that, without the need for learning rate tuning, our proposed MH-signSGD matches the state-of-art sublinear convergence rate O(1/root K) in nonconvex settings, where K is the number of iterations. Our adaptive learning strategy is based on stochastically approximating the learning rate found by greedily minimizing an error upper bound between two successive iterations. Moreover, by leveraging a normal approximation technique to characterize stochastic gradient sign error, we are able to sharpen the convergence analysis of MH-sighSGD with a fixed learning rate 1/root K and establish a strong result in the large-system regime, which says that the MH-signSGD algorithm asymptotically converges to a stationary point at rate O(1/root M), where M is the number of workers. In comparison, most existing work on signSGD can only prove a weaker finite neighborhood convergence in the large system regime. We validate our theoretical results experimentally both on synthetic data and real-world datasets.

Dynamic subgrid-scale scalar-flux model based on the exact rate of production of turbulent fluxes	PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS			English	Article								A dynamic subgrid-scale (SGS) scalar-flux model, based on the exact rate of production of turbulent scalar fluxes, is proposed. The model is derived from an assumption that the pressure-scalar correlation in the equation for turbulent scalar flux is a vector that is approximately aligned with the scalar flux itself. The formulation then yields a tensor diffusivity which allows nonalignment of the SGS scalar fluxes with respect to the resolved scalar gradient. In contrast to eddy diffusivity models and to general gradient diffusion hypothesis models, for which the diffusivity tensor is symmetric, the present formulation produces an asymmetric diffusion tensor; for theoretical and experimental reasons, that tensor is known to be very asymmetric. The model contains a single coefficient, which is determined dynamically. The model is validated in fully developed turbulent channel flow and in separated and reattaching flow over a backstep.

In this work, the virtual force stabilization technique introduced by Schwarz et al. [Schwarz, S., Kempe, T., & Frohlich, J. (2015). A temporal discretization scheme to compute the motion of light particles in viscous flows by an immersed boundary method. J. Comput. Phys., 281, 591-613] is extended to simulate buoyant particle suspensions with high volume fractions (up to 40%). It is concluded that the dimensionless numerical model constant C-v in the virtual force technique should increase with volume fraction. The behavior of a single rising particle, two in-line rising particles, and buoyant particle suspensions are studied. In each case, results are compared with experimental works on bubbly flows to highlight the differences and similarities between buoyant particles and bubbles. Finally, the drag coefficient is extracted from simulations of buoyant particle suspensions at different volume fractions, and based on that a drag correlation is presented. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in poultry animals, a closer examination into the health benefits and limitations of commercial, live prophylactics as an alternative to antibiotics is urgently needed. In this review, we summarize the peer-reviewed literature of several commercial live bacterial vaccines and probiotics. Per our estimation, there is a paucity of peer-reviewed published research regarding these products, making repeatability, product-comparison, and understanding biological mechanisms difficult. Furthermore, we briefly-outline significant issues such as probiotic-label accuracy, lack of commercially available live bacterial vaccines for major poultry-related bacteria such as Campylobacter and Clostridium perfringens, as well research gaps (i.e., probiotic-mediated vaccine adjuvancy, gut-brain-microbiota axis). Increased emphasis on these areas would open several avenues for research, ranging from improving protection against bacterial pathogens to using these prophylactics to modulate animal behavior.

Here, we use meta-analytic methods and data from 18 unique samples and a total sample size of 3,525 students to shed light on the validity of prior research experience as a predictor of graduate school performance. Prior research experience was largely unrelated to academic performance (rho = .01,k = 8,N = 1,419), degree attainment (rho = .05,k = 3,N = 140), professional/practice performance (rho = .06,k = 4,N =1,120), and publication performance (rho = .11, k = 7,N = 1,094). We also discuss whether consideration of prior research experience may unfairly disadvantage the students with lower levels of SES, students with childcare or eldercare responsibilities, and students from institutions at which research opportunities are limited.

Yearling Muskellunge Poststocking Behavior and Survival in Two Central Iowa Reservoirs with Contrasting Habitat Availability	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article							COARSE WOODY HABITAT; STOCKED JUVENILE MUSKELLUNGE; BROWN TROUT; SURGICAL-PROCEDURES; ESOX MASQUINONGY; RAINBOW-TROUT; HOME-RANGE; 3 ESOCIDS; MORTALITY; LAKE	MuskellungeEsox masquinongyis a prized sport fish throughout much of North America. Due to the species' popularity among anglers and limited natural recruitment in reservoirs, Muskellunge are commonly stocked to maintain populations. However, little is known about their poststocking behavior and survival in reservoirs. We used radiotelemetry to evaluate behavior and survival of spring-stocked yearling Muskellunge in two Iowa reservoirs that differed in habitat availability (Big Creek Lake: limited habitat; Brushy Creek Lake: abundant habitat). Hatchery-reared Muskellunge were implanted with radio transmitters (n = 15-16 fish center dot lake(-1)center dot year(-1); 61 fish total) and stocked in both lakes during May 2017 and 2018; fish were tracked daily for 1 week, every other day for the second week, and then weekly until December. Telemetry data were used to evaluate depth and vegetation use, selection of littoral substrate and coarse woody habitat (CWH) complexities, movement, home ranges, and survival. Muskellunge depth use generally increased with time poststocking and was greater in Brushy Creek Lake than in Big Creek Lake. Movement rates were greatest during the first week poststocking and declined thereafter, with greater rates and home ranges in Big Creek Lake. Muskellunge in both systems selected for fine substrates while avoiding coarse substrates. Muskellunge in Brushy Creek Lake were more commonly associated with CWH and aquatic vegetation compared to those in Big Creek Lake. Muskellunge in Big Creek Lake selected for complex CWH, while those in Brushy Creek Lake used CWH classes in proportion to their availability. Cormack-Jolly-Seber daily apparent survival estimates were lowest for the first 4 d poststocking and ranged from 0.59 to 0.99, after which survival increased from May to September before declining in October and November. Results of this study provide a greater understanding of the poststocking success of yearling Muskellunge and suggest that Muskellunge behavior and survival are dependent on habitat complexity, with weaker habitat selection but higher survival in complex systems.

J	Robson, G				Robson, Gregory			The rationality of political experimentation	POLITICS PHILOSOPHY & ECONOMICS			English	Article						entrepreneurship; experiments in living; justice; liberalism; political tradition; rationality	LOCK-IN; PATH	Theorists from John Stuart Mill to Robert Nozick have argued that citizens can gain insight into the demands of justice by experimenting with diverse forms of political life. I consider the rationality of such experimentation, arguing for three distinct but related claims. First, rational citizens will not be highly incentivized to conduct experiments in living. Here I develop an account of what I call the 'prudential rationality constraint' (PRC). The PRC implies that rational citizens will be undermotivated from the standpoint of social value to conduct experiments in living. Second, despite the success of various radical political experiments (e.g., democracy after 1648), citizens generally ought to engage in moderate rather than radical political experimentation. The latter will nearly always be prudentially irrational to conduct, hard to learn from, and quite possibly harmful to participants and third parties. Finally, there are important but overlooked ways, including through entrepreneurship, in which institutions can incentivize citizens to engage in socially valuable political experimentation.

Design/methodology/approach Eighteen in-depth interviews were conducted with male and female participants who self-identified as NFL fans from the Midwest and Northeast regions of the US. Data were analyzed using open coding. Findings Both female and male participants identified three common criteria for being a prototypical NFL fan: loyalty, knowledge and wearing of team apparel. The findings also demonstrated gender differences in both how a fan identifies a prototypical fan and how that dictates fan identity, attitudes and behavior. Additionally, prototypical fandom might need to be defined differently for males and females. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by exploring the perspectives of both genders of NFL fans and by providing a more balanced perspective of how males and females define prototypical fans and how each gender perceives the fan behavior of the opposite sex.

Small Noncoding RNA CjNC110 Influences Motility, Autoagglutination, AI-2 Localization, Hydrogen Peroxide Sensitivity, and Chicken Colonization in Campylobacter jejuni	INFECTION AND IMMUNITY			English	Article						Campylobacter; noncoding RNA; pathogenesis; quorum sensing; small RNA	MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; VIBRIO-HARVEYI; EXPRESSION; SYSTEM; GENES; IDENTIFICATION; SEQUENCE; TRANSCRIPTION; CLONE	Small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are involved in many important physiological functions in pathogenic microorganisms. Previous studies have identified the presence of noncoding RNAs in the major zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter jejuni; however, few have been functionally characterized to date. CjNC110 is a conserved ncRNA in C. jejuni, located downstream of the IuxS gene, which is responsible for the production of the quorum sensing molecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2). In this study, we utilized strand specific high-throughput RNAseq to identify potential targets or interactive partners of CjNC110 in a sheep abortion clone of C. jejuni. These data were then utilized to focus further phenotypic evaluation of the role of CjNC110 in motility, autoagglutination, quorum sensing, hydrogen peroxide sensitivity, and chicken colonization in C. jejuni. Inactivation of the CjNC110 ncRNA led to a statistically significant decrease in autoagglutination ability as well as increased motility and hydrogen peroxide sensitivity compared to the wild-type. Extracellular AI-2 detection was decreased in Delta CjNC110; however, intracellular AI-2 accumulation was significantly increased, suggesting a key role of CjNC110 in modulating the transport of AI-2. Notably, Delta CjNC110 also showed a decreased ability to colonize chickens. Complementation of CjNC110 restored all phenotypic changes back to wild-type levels. The collective results of the phenotypic and transcriptomic changes observed in our data provide valuable insights into the pathobiology of C. jejuni sheep abortion clone and strongly suggest that CjNC110 plays an important role in the regulation of energy taxis, flagellar glycosylation, cellular communication via quorum sensing, oxidative stress tolerance, and chicken colonization in this important zoonotic pathogen.

Stepfamily Policies and Laws in the United States: Lessons from the West	JOURNAL OF FAMILY ISSUES			English	Article						incomplete institutionalization; laws; policies; stepfamilies; Western countries	FAMILY; LEGAL; STEPPARENTS; CUSTODY; MOTHERS	Although stepfamilies exist in some form in nearly every country in the world, they are most common in Western countries. This paper provides a summary of laws, policies, and programs pertaining to stepfamilies in a selection of Western countries, with a special focus on the United States. Although stepfamilies have been prevalent throughout the West for decades, they remain "incompletely institutionalized," and governments have been slow to address their needs and concerns. There is large variation across Western countries with respect to how stepfamilies are treated under the law, with some countries employing more liberal definitions of "parents," "children," and "families," than others. In contrast, stepfamilies in the United States must contend with a complex and conflicting set of federal laws, state laws, and court precedents. Their legal status is uncertain and the way stepfamilies are treated is inconsistent across social programs and policies. Overall, there is clear bias against stepfamilies within most U.S. institutions. The review includes recommendations for change that would enhance stepfamily stability and quality of life in both Western and non-Western contexts.

A case study in religion and permaculture in Santiago	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY RELIGION			English	Article						Cuba; sustainability; ecology; permaculture; religion; ecumenical		Using the analysis of ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Santiago, this article explores the relationships between religion, ecology, and permaculture in contemporary Cuba. I focus on qualitative interviews with permaculture activists who are affiliated with the Eastern Baptist Convention. These activists are working with an ecumenical center in Santiago that promotes the creation of sustainable local communities through programs dedicated to social service. This article argues that these individuals have embraced a theocentric ecological ethic that combines social and environmental justice. The cultural value ofsolidaridad(social solidarity), which has long been part of Cuba's revolutionary history, is shaping the development of this ecological ethic.

Our focus is on the realistic sampling case of bivariate panel data (repeated contaminated bivariate measurements on each sample unit) with an unknown error distribution. Several factors can affect the performance of kernel deconvolution density estimators, including the choice of the kernel and the estimation approach of the unknown error distribution. As the choice of the kernel function is critically important, the class of flat-top kernels can have advantages over more commonly implemented alternatives. We describe different approaches for density estimation with multivariate panel responses, and investigate their performance through simulation. We examine competing kernel functions and describe a flat-top kernel that has not been used in deconvolution problems. Moreover, we study several nonparametric options for estimating the unknown error distribution. Finally, we also provide guidelines to the numerical implementation of kernel deconvolution in higher sampling dimensions.

AC and DC Differential Bridge Structure Suitable for Electrochemical Interfacial Capacitance Biosensing Applications	BIOSENSORS-BASEL			English	Article						biosensor; electrochemical capacitive bridge; sensitivity; linearity; low-cost; AC/DC excitation; balancing; field deployable; drift; real-time	IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; GOLD	This paper presents a capacitive differential bridge structure with both AC and DC excitation and balancing capability for low cost electrode-solution interfacial capacitance biosensing applications. The proposed series RC balancing structure offers higher sensitivity, lower susceptibility to common-mode interferences, and drift control. To evaluate the bridge performance in practice, possible effects of initial bridge imbalance due to component mismatches are investigated considering the required resolution of the balancing networks, sensitivity, and linearity. This evaluation is also a guideline to designing the balancing networks, balancing algorithm and the proceeding readout interface circuitry. The proposed series RC bridge structure is implemented along with a custom single frequency real-time amplification/filtering readout board with real-time data acquisition and sine fitting. The main specifications for the implemented structure are 8-bit detection resolution if the total expected fractional capacitance change at the interface is roughly 1%. The characterization and measurement results show the effectiveness of the proposed structure in achieving the design target. The implemented structure successfully achieves distinct detection levels for tiny total capacitance change at the electrode-solution interface, utilizing Microcystin-(Leucine-Arginine) toxin dilutions as a proof of concept.

A total of 199 Chinese international students from two Midwestern universities in the United States participated. Results indicated support for both hypotheses. First, cognitive flexibility significantly mediated the association between acculturative stress and ethnocultural empathy. Second, relativistic appreciation significantly moderated the effects of acculturative stress on ethnocultural empathy. Specifically, the effect of acculturative stress on ethnocultural empathy was significantly negative for those with relativistic appreciation levels below the 26th percentile. Conversely, this effect was not significant for those with relativistic appreciation levels above the 26th percentile. Our results offer a new perspective on acculturative stress, provides tools for clinicians working with Chinese international students who are coping with acculturative stress, and advocates for culturally appropriate coping strategies.

However, little is known about this interaction in chickens despite their importance in food production. Probiotics and live Salmonella vaccines are microbial products commonly given orally to layer pullets to improve health and ensure food safety. This study's objective was to determine how these oral treatments, individually or in combination, would impact the gut environment of chickens. White Leghorn chicks were either non-treated (CON) or orally given probiotics (PRO), a recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccine (RASV; VAX), or both (P+V). Birds were fed with probiotics daily beginning at 1-day-old and orally immunized with RASV at 4-days-old and boosted 2 weeks post-primary vaccination. At 5 weeks, ceca content, ceca tissues, and small intestinal scrapings (SISs) were collected from ten birds/group post-euthanasia for analyses. Catecholamine, but not serotonergic, metabolism was affected by treatments. Dopamine metabolism, indicated by L-DOPA and DOPAC levels, were increased in P+V birds versus CON and PRO birds. Based on 16S sequencing, beta diversity was more similar among vaccinated birds versus birds given probiotics, suggesting live Salmonella vaccination has a major selective pressure on microbial diversity. Abundances of Akkermansia muciniphila and Enterobacteriaceae positively correlated with levels of tyrosine and norepinephrine, respectively. Both enumeration and 16S sequencing, determined that PRO exhibited the greatest levels of Enterobacteriaceae in the ceca and feces, which was associated with greater IgA production against E. coli virulence factors as tested by ELISA. In summary, we demonstrate that using probiotics alone versus in combination with a live vaccine has major implications in catecholamine production and the microbiota of layer pullets. Additionally, unique correlations between changes in some neurochemicals and specific bacteria have been shown.	[Redweik, Graham A.

LARGE-SCALE FIELD STUDY OF IMPACT-BASED YIELD MONITOR PERFORMANCE	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Combine harvesters; Mass flow; Precision agriculture; Real-time sensor; Yield map; Yield monitor	ACCURACY	The grain yield monitor is the most common evaluation tool for determining the productivity of grain cropping systems. Most evaluations of grain yield monitors have focused on lab scale tests of the sensor performance and its ability to be calibrated in field trials. This study focused on the performance of the impact-based grain yield monitor during a full corn harvest season with observations and conclusions drawn on the load-to-load variation, field level, and full season accuracy from data collected over five seasons and encompassing over 2,000 evaluation loads. The load variance expectation of the impact-based yield monitor was characterized and the yield difference requirements for statistical significance were developed to aid in yield monitor based evaluations of agronomic strip trials. Following manufacturer recommended calibrations, a single cropping season calibration in corn produced field mean errors of +/- 5% and a season mean error of 1%. Results showed statistically significant shift in the yield monitor accuracy for grain moisture content greater than 22.5% and a load accuracy dependency on the mean mass flow rate during the full harvest season calibration evaluation.

Most of all, it had to be the many eager minds that I have had the fortune to work with. I have always tried to suggest research topics that might be interesting to the individual coworker rather than something straight out of my own research proposals.

Investigations into Reactions between Sodium Metal and Na3PS4-xOx Solid-State Electrolytes: Enhanced Stability of the Na3PS3O Solid-State Electrolyte	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						solid electrolyte; glass; sodium thiophosphate; stability; sodium metal		Understanding the interfacial reactions between sodium metal (SM) and the solid-state electrolyte (SSE) Na3PS4 (NPS) and its oxygen-doped derivatives, Na3PS4-xOx (NPSO), will help develop a strategy to stabilize the SM-SSE interface. Previous reports have demonstrated that NPS is a promising SSE due to its high ionic conductivity, but it is known to be unstable against SM. This chemical instability and hence reactivity are critical problems in most sulfide materials, and in this work, we report one of the very first detailed studies of the reaction between SM and NPSO SSEs. It was discovered that the reaction between SM and Na3PS4 is facilitated simply by contact and is not driven by a forced potential difference. A combination of powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy was used to identify the main reaction product as the reduced phosphide Na3P. Additionally, the reaction is significantly slowed but not completely eliminated by the addition of oxygen in NPSO oxy-sulfide SSEs. We find that NPS is unstable because the SM-NPS reaction layer product is heavily exfoliated, allowing further sodium reaction between the newly created sheets. This degradation mechanism results in further chemical reaction until either the metallic sodium or NPS SSE is fully consumed, whichever is the limiting reagent in the reaction. As oxygen is added, x > 0, the SSE surface remains dense and is slower to react, making it more difficult for the SM to react through the NPSO SSE. The central finding here is that in our work, we find that the x = 1 Na3PS3O SSE remains unreacted with SM over periods of months at room temperature and so far appears to be one of the very few sulfide-based SSEs that is stable against SM and as such is a highly promising SSE for all solid-state sodium batteries (ASSSBs).

Elucidating the Role of Hydrogen Bond Donor and Acceptor on Solvation in Deep Eutectic Solvents Formed by Ammonium/Phosphonium Salts and Carboxylic Acids	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article						salvation interactions; gas chromatography; separations; extractions; green solvents; desulfurization; natural products	CHOLINE CHLORIDE; INTERMOLECULAR INTERACTIONS; SOLVATOCHROMIC PARAMETERS; IONIC LIQUIDS; EXTRACTION; MEDIA; TEMPERATURE; DISSOLUTION; MIXTURES; BEHAVIOR	Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) constitute a rapidly emerging class of sustainable liquids that have been widely studied and employed in chemical separations, catalysis, and electrochemistry. The unique physicochemical and solvation properties of DESs can be highly tailored by choosing the appropriate hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and hydrogen bond donor (HBD). Understanding the role of the HBA and HBD on the multiple solvation interactions in DESs is important to enable their judicious selection for particular applications. This work constitutes the first study to exploit chromatography to measure solute-solvent interactions of DESs using a wide array of known probe molecules. The constituent components of 20 DESs, formed by ammonium and phosphonium-based salts and carboxylic acids, are systematically modulated to delineate the contribution of the HBA and HBD toward individual solvation properties. Solute-solvent interactions measured in this study are used to interpret and explain the performance of DESs in desulfurization of fuels and extraction of natural products. The results from this study can be used to predict and understand the performance of DESs in various chemical processes where solvation interactions heavily influence outcomes.

Rossoni			High-Fat Diets Led to OTU-Level Shifts in Fecal Samples of Healthy Adult Dogs	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						dogs; high fat diet; low carbohydrate; health; microbiota	BILE-ACID METABOLISM; GUT MICROBIOTA; GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT; GEN. NOV.; BACTERIAL MICROBIOTA; MOLECULAR ANALYSIS; INDUCED OBESITY; RNA; COMMUNITIES; CLOSTRIDIUM	High fat diets have been reported to negatively affect the microbiota in both mice and humans. However, there is a lack of studies in canine models. The variation among the gastrointestinal (GI) tract anatomy/physiology and typical diet compositions of these animal species may lead to vastly different results. Due to the large inclusion rate of dietary fat in pet food, it is critical to understand its effects in a canine model. Therefore, the study objective was to report the effects of high fat, low carbohydrate diets on the fecal microbiota in healthy adult dogs. Eight adult beagles were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments within each 15-day period of a replicated 4x4 Latin Square design. Diets contained 32% (T1), 37% (T2), 42% (T3), and 47% (T4) fat. T2, T3, and T4 were created by adding increasing levels of canola oil to T1, a commercially manufactured canned canine diet, which served as the control diet. Fresh fecal samples were collected during the last 5 days of each period for microbial analysis. DNA was extracted from fecal samples and paired-end 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. When comparing whole microbial communities using PERMANOVA, no significant differences were observed among treatments (P = 0.735). Individual OTUs were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS with fixed effects of diet and room, and the random effects of period and animal. Out of the 100 most abundant individual OTUs, 36 showed significant differences in abundance based on treatment (q < 0.05). Overall, OTUs assigned to genera related to fat digestion increased while OTUs assigned to genera involved in carbohydrate digestion decreased. In conclusion, the microbial community adapted to dietary intervention without jeopardizing the health of the animals, evaluated by body condition score, fecal characteristics, and blood parameters.

Mental Simulation in Narrative Comprehension and Construction	PSYCHOLOGY OF CONSCIOUSNESS-THEORY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article						mental simulation; narrative; storytelling; social perception	PARTICIPATORY RESPONSES; TRANSPORTATION; MODELS; IDENTIFICATION; STORIES; FICTION	Narrative cognition is a fundamental component of event comprehension and social communication. The present article examines the role of mental simulation in narrative cognition and how the mental simulation process affects social judgments. In the course of narrative text comprehension, readers develop rich mental representations of the described events by combining textual information with their own world knowledge. personal experiences, and causal inferences. Readers can then psychologically transport themselves into these simulated worlds and experience the narrative events as if the events were happening directly to them, a process that results in changes to the readers' real-world beliefs and social perceptions. Additionally. individuals construct narratives of observed events and life experiences. Similar to narrative readers, narrative creators also develop rich mental representations of the events and these mental representations in turn guide their social perceptions and judgments. The present article illustrates the strong connection between narrative cognition and mental simulation and highlights how when operating in concert, these processes can disrupt automatic cognitive biases related to social perception.

Several studies have confirmed the benefits of using augmented reality (AR) work instructions over traditional digital or paper instructions, but few have compared the effects of different AR hardware, including head-mounted displays, for complex assembly tasks. Participants completed a mock wing assembly task using the Microsoft HoloLens 1, and completion time, error count, and net promoter score (NPS) were recorded. These data were compared to data from previous research which employed desktop model-based instructions (MBIs), tablet MBI, and tablet AR instructions for the same task. The use of HoloLens AR instructions led to time saving of 16% over the tablet AR instructions. HoloLens users also had lower error rates than non-AR users. Despite the performance benefits of the HoloLens AR instructions, this condition had a lower NPS than the tablet AR group. The qualitative data showed that some users thought the HoloLens device was uncomfortable and that the tracking was not always exact. Although the users favored the tablet AR condition, the HoloLens condition had significantly faster assembly times. The authors recommend using the HoloLens for complex guided assembly instructions with minor changes, such as allowing the user to toggle the AR instructions on and off at will. The results of this paper can help manufacturing stakeholders understand the benefits of different AR technologies for manual assembly tasks.

J	Kostelnick, C				Kostelnick, Charles			The Art of Visual Design: The Rhetoric of Aesthetics in Technical Communication	TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION			English	Article						aesthetics in technical communication; visual rhetoric; history of information design; technical illustrations; data visualization		Purpose: By recognizing the importance of aesthetics, which have infused technical communication for centuries, designers can more effectively meet audience expectations and achieve key rhetorical goals, including heightening audience engagement, arousing emotion, and enhancing credibility and persuasiveness. Designers can integrate aesthetics into technical communications by deploying visual conventions generated by larger cultural forces, by applying design principles that foster beauty, and by inventing novel forms. Methods: Aesthetic theory, both ancient and modern, and insights from practitioners create a foundation for defining beauty; research and usability studies examining audience preferences provide empirical evidence about the functional value of aesthetics; and aesthetic developments in the nineteenth century and the subsequent shift to Modernism serve to illustrate the cultural influences on design. The Design Methods Movement affords a springboard for exploring the design process and the nature of creativity. Results: Although theorists and practitioners hold conflicting views on the role of aesthetics in functional design, many consider it an important factor that makes designs attractive and engaging to audiences. The pursuit of beauty continues today through the application of culturally based conventions and design principles associated with beauty. Conclusion: The cultural knowledge embedded in visual aesthetics operates silently, even imperceptibly, as technical communicators deploy aesthetic conventions to meet audience expectations and to streamline their design processes. At the same time, technical communicators need leeway for creativity and novelty as they adapt visual elements to specific rhetorical situations, often seeking audience feedback about their aesthetic preferences to create engaging, persuasive, and usable designs.

J	Henao-Diaz, A; Gimenez-Lirola, L; Baum, DH; Zimmerman, J				Henao-Diaz, Alexandra; Gimenez-Lirola, Luis; Baum, David H.; Zimmerman, Jeffrey			Guidelines for oral fluid-based surveillance of viral pathogens in swine	PORCINE HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Oral fluids; Surveillance; Viral diseases; ELISA; RT-PCR	RESPIRATORY-SYNDROME-VIRUS; INFLUENZA-A VIRUS; SAMPLING METHOD; INFECTION; ANTIBODY; DISEASE; COLLECTION; SPECIMENS; PRRSV; PIGS	Recent decades have seen both rapid growth and extensive consolidation in swine production. As a collateral effect, these changes have exacerbated the circulation of viruses and challenged our ability to prevent, control, and/or eliminate impactful swine diseases. Recent pandemic events in human and animal health, e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and African swine fever virus, highlight the fact that clinical observations are too slow and inaccurate to form the basis for effective health management decisions: systematic processes that provide timely, reliable data are required. Oral fluid-based surveillance reflects the adaptation of conventional testing methods to an alternative diagnostic specimen. The routine use of oral fluids in commercial farms for PRRSV and PCV2 surveillance was first proposed in 2008 as an efficient and practical improvement on individual pig sampling. Subsequent research expanded on this initial report to include the detection of >= 23 swine viral pathogens and the implementation of oral fluid-based surveillance in large swine populations (> 12,000 pigs). Herein we compile the current information regarding oral fluid collection methods, testing, and surveillance applications in swine production.

RESEARCH POLICY			English	Article						National income; Research and development; Education; Bias; Survey	DETERMINANTS; PISA; STEREOTYPES; EDUCATION; GENDER; POLICY; GROWTH; LEVEL; FIRMS	Perceptions of countries' policy environments and innovation efforts drive important investment and regulatory decisions, but those perceptions may be biased. One particular concern is that evaluations of richer countries might be inflated compared to evaluations of poorer countries, as general stereotypes of national success spill over into assessments of research capability. Comparison of World Economic Forum survey assessments of businesses' research spending with official spending figures reveals that, among countries spending comparable amounts on research, richer countries receive higher survey ratings. Richer countries' educational outcomes are similarly rated higher than similarly performing poorer countries'. These findings suggest that perceptions may systematically disadvantage economically poorer countries, thereby misdirecting real-world investments and policy decisions derived from those rankings.

Bologna raw batters containing either pork backfat (PBF) or OGs were more stable (P < .05) than those containing liquid soybean oil, but no differences in yield were observed. TBARS values remained consistently low throughout the 98-d storage period. Color a*, b*, chroma and sensory color intensity were higher, and L* and hue angle lower, when pork backfat was the lipid source. There were no significant effects of lipid source or storage time on texture profile analysis parameters and incisor peak force. There were no sensory differences (P < .05) in aroma, flavor, texture, and moistness, but color was more intense (P < .05) in PBF-containing product. Bologna made with PBF had the largest lipid globules and that made with liquid soybean oil the smallest. Overall, type of soybean oil did not affect product quality, except HOSO OGs resulted in product with a more favorable fatty acid profile.

Animals studied Eight female spayed Beagle dogs (1.5-2 years old, 7.5-10 kg). Procedures On two consecutive days, one randomly selected eye in each dog received 1 or 375 mg/mL histamine solution to induce mild or severe conjunctivitis, while the contralateral eye served as control. Diagnostic tests were performed in the following order: fluorescein instillation and repeated tear collection over 20 minutes (to determine tear volume [TV] and turnover rate [TTR] by fluorophotometry), Schirmer tear test-1 (STT-1), tear ferning, corneal esthesiometry, and tear film breakup time (TFBUT). Results Results are presented as median values for severe conjunctivitis, mild conjunctivitis, and control eyes. Eyes with severe conjunctivitis had significantly higher STT-1 (24, 19.5, 17.5 mm/min;P = .002) and significantly lower TFBUT (10.5, 13.5, 15.5 s;P = .002), but no changes were noted in corneal tactile sensation (2, 2.5, 2.5 cm) or tear ferning (grades 2, 2, 2.5). Severe conjunctivitis significantly increased TV by nearly 10-fold (631, 97, 65 mu L) initially (reflex tearing), although basal TV returned rapidly (<5 minutes) in all eyes (46, 58, 48 mu L). Finally, there was a nonsignificant trend for higher reflex TTR in the conjunctivitis vs control eyes (68, 58, 43%/min). Conclusions Experimentally induced conjunctivitis increases tear quantity and decreases tear quality in dogs, but has no impact on corneal sensitivity. Changes in tear film dynamics could affect ocular pharmacology (eg, precorneal retention time), although homeostasis of lacrimal volume and drainage is rapidly restored.

J	Park, YW				Park, Young Woong			MILP Models for Complex System Reliability Redundancy Allocation with Mixed Components	INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						integer programming; reliability redundancy allocation; data aggregation; aggregate and iterative disaggregate	MINIMAL CUT-SETS; SERIES SYSTEM; PERCENTILE LIFE; MULTIPLE-CHOICE; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM; PAIR	The redundancy allocation problem (RAP) aims to find an optimal allocation of redundant components subject to resource constraints. In this paper, mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models and MILP-based algorithms are proposed for complex system reliability redundancy allocation problem with mixed components, where the system have bridges or interconnecting subsystems and each subsystem can have mixed types of components. Unlike the other algorithms in the literature, the proposed MILP models view the problem from a different point of view and approximate the nonconvex nonlinear system reliability function of a complex system using random samples. The solution to the MILP converges to the optimal solution of the original problem as sample size increases. In addition, data aggregation-based algorithms are proposed to improve the solution time and quality based on the proposed MILP models. A computational experiment shows that the proposed models and algorithms converge to the optimal or best-known solution as sample size increases. The proposed algorithms outperform popular metaheuristic algorithms in the literature.

J	Urbatsch, R				Urbatsch, Robert			REVISITING "THE FIRST-DAUGHTER EFFECT"	PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY			English	Article							DAUGHTERS; SONS	A recent Public Opinion Quarterly article argued that men whose first children were girls rather than boys-daughters rather than sons-were more likely to support gender-equality policies. This note reexamines the coding and model specification of that analysis, focusing on the definition of "first daughters" and on the inclusion, perilously for causal inference, of control variables that are more probably consequences than causes of the independent variable of interest. In the tested alternative specifications, the predicted effect of first-child sex diminishes, usually falling short of standard benchmarks for statistical significance.

Oesophageal ectasia as a cause of dysphagia and milk regurgitation in a neonatal foal	EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION			English	Article						horse; congenital; dysfunction; oesophagus; pharynx	RIGHT AORTIC-ARCH; PULSION DIVERTICULUM; CERVICAL ESOPHAGUS; MEGAESOPHAGUS; DUPLICATION; DYSFUNCTION; STRICTURE; PORTION; HORSES; PALATE	Dysphagia and milk regurgitation are relatively infrequently observed clinical signs in neonatal foals but, when present, can commonly arise from anatomic or functional disorders of the upper airway. Less commonly, milk regurgitation can be caused by anatomic or neuromuscular disorders of the oesophagus. In the report presented here, a neonatal foal was examined for milk regurgitation at 4 days of age and was diagnosed with transient oesophageal ectasia via oesophagoscopy and contrast radiography. Aspiration pneumonia was treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials and the owner was instructed to intermittently elevate the forelimbs to facilitate passage of milk out of the dilated oesophagus. The milk regurgitation resolved and reassessment of the foal at 6 weeks of age documented the absence of oesophageal ectasia and resolution of aspiration pneumonia. The foal was reported to be healthy and consuming food normally 6 months after initial examination and was in good body condition. This case is unique in that the oesophageal ectasia improved with time; furthermore, other potential causes of dysphagia and milk regurgitation of oesophageal origin in neonatal foals are discussed.

Life Cycle Assessment of Urea-Formaldehyde Adhesive and Phenol-Formaldehyde Adhesives	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Life cycle assessment (LCA); Urea-formaldehyde adhesive (UF adhesive); Phenol-formaldehyde adhesive (PF adhesive)	RESINS; LIGNIN; PAPER	Traditional formaldehyde-based adhesives still play a crucial role in the current market, despite increasing environmental concerns resulting from their production. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the environmental impacts of formaldehyde-based adhesives, urea-formaldehyde (UF) adhesive and phenol-formaldehyde (PF) adhesives, mainly used in wood products. In this study, a functional unit of 1 kg adhesive was used. GaBi 6 software was employed to perform the life cycle assessment (LCA). Several key parameters for life cycle analysis were analyzed, such as global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, and human health. As a result, the greenhouse gas emissions ranged from 2.04 kg CO2-eq./kg of UF adhesive to 2.88 kg CO2-eq./kg of PF adhesive. In terms of the overall environmental impacts, it was found that UF adhesive had a nearly 50% higher life cycle impact than PF adhesive. Comparing the energy consumption used in UF and PF adhesives, UF adhesive was much lower than PF adhesive. Transportation distance was determined to be a sensitive parameter with respect to global warming potential for formaldehyde-based adhesive.

CRISPR-Cas12a has widespread off-target and dsDNA-nicking effects	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						CRISPR; Cas; crRNA; substrate specificity; DNA endonuclease; deoxyribonuclease (DNase); bacterial immunity; Cas12a; genome editing; mismatch tolerance; cleavage activity; nickase; FnCas12a; LbCas12a; AsCas12a	RNA-GUIDED ENDONUCLEASE; R-LOOP COMPLEX; STRUCTURAL BASIS; DNA; CAS9; CLEAVAGE; GENOME; CPF1; RESISTANCE; DYNAMICS	Cas12a (Cpf1) is an RNA-guided endonuclease in the bacterial type V-A CRISPR-Cas anti-phage immune system that can be repurposed for genome editing. Cas12a can bind and cut dsDNA targets with high specificity in vivo, making it an ideal candidate for expanding the arsenal of enzymes used in precise genome editing. However, this reported high specificity contradicts Cas12a's natural role as an immune effector against rapidly evolving phages. Here, we employed high-throughput in vitro cleavage assays to determine and compare the native cleavage specificities and activities of three different natural Cas12a orthologs (FnCas12a, LbCas12a, and AsCas12a). Surprisingly, we observed pervasive sequence-specific nicking of randomized target libraries, with strong nicking of DNA sequences containing up to four mismatches in the Cas12a-targeted DNA-RNA hybrid sequences. We also found that these nicking and cleavage activities depend on mismatch type and position and vary with Cas12a ortholog and CRISPR RNA sequence. Our analysis further revealed robust nonspecific nicking of dsDNA when Cas12a is activated by binding to a target DNA. Together, our findings reveal that Cas12a has multiple nicking activities against dsDNA substrates and that these activities vary among different Cas12a orthologs.

The study utilized administrative data (2,208 electronic records from the Bureau of Health Statistics) on voluntary paternity affidavits (VPA) rejected by the Iowa Department of Public Health. These records represented all rejected VPAs from 70 hospitals in Iowa for 6 months in 2017. Results indicated that the majority of VPAs were not accepted for minor errors (78%) such as missing information rather than incorrect information. Results also indicated variation among hospitals and hospital regions in the reasons for rejection. Outreach to hospitals targeting affidavit completion is a potential step for increasing paternity establishment.

We argue that in their protests, surfers sought to defend a historically particular enactment of the Costa Verde's infrastructure, one that would ensure the ongoing conditions for producing rideable waves. However, this enactment of the Costa Verde's nature historically has been rooted in and reproduced discursive constructions of race and class in Lima's elite social geographies. Our analysis of surfers' efforts to save their waves reveals the subtle ways in which broader inequalities are remade, sometimes unintentionally, in infrastructural struggles.

Impact of Detector Configuration on Performance Measurement and Signal Operations	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							EVENT-BASED DATA	In recent years, automated traffic signal performance measures (ATSPMs) have emerged as a means of developing situational awareness of traffic conditions at intersections and assessing the quality of signal operations. As a growing number of agencies are adopting the technology, there is a need to understand how detector configurations can influence the outcomes of an analysis using ATSPM. Current practices with regard to detector configuration vary considerably from one agency to another; at one extreme, agencies may use one single detector input channel per phase without considering where the detectors are located, whereas at the other extreme, some agencies may utilize all possible channels to observe each individual lane at multiple positions. There are also variations in the design of detection zones (lengths and positions). This study takes on the problem in two parts. The first of these examines the impact of stop bar detection zone length and lane- or approach-based detector assignment on the ability of performance measures to identify accurately whether split failures occur. The second part examines the impact of setback detector distance on the use of a "percentage on green" metric that serves as a proxy measurement of the number of stops. The paper presents recommendations for performance measure calibrations and detector configurations that follow from these outcomes.	[Emtenan, A. M.

However, these techniques are labor intensive, time-consuming, and costly to obtain a large number of particles. Therefore, it is desirable if computers can be taught to generate realistic particles based on given morphological properties. This paper develops a particle generation technique by integrating spherical harmonics and probability functions. This technique only requires morphological information from one particle to generate a large number of particles and eliminates the need for scanning many particles for particle generation. The spherical harmonics coefficients of this particle are analog of the morphological gene. The probability function is used to add variances to spherical harmonics coefficients to simulate gene mutation. A dimensionless factor is developed to control degrees of gene mutation. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed technique are verified by particle shape descriptors computed by the computational geometry techniques.

Due to the high computational cost of MCE, parallel methods are imperative for dealing with large graphs. We present shared-memory parallel algorithms for MCE, with the following properties: (1) the parallel algorithms are provably work-efficient relative to a state-of-the-art sequential algorithm, (2) the algorithms have a provably small parallel depth, showing they can scale to a large number of processors, and (3) our implementations on a multicore machine show good speedup and scaling behavior with increasing number of cores and are substantially faster than prior shared-memory parallel algorithms for MCE; for instance, on certain input graphs, while prior works either ran out of memory or did not complete in five hours, our implementation finished within a minute using 32 cores. We also present work-efficient parallel algorithms for maintaining the set of all maximal cliques in a dynamic graph that is changing through the addition of edges.

Evaluation of the effect of beta-mannanase supplementation and mannans on nursery pig growth performance and serum acute-phase protein concentrations	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						beta-mannan; beta-mannanase; C-reactive protein; feed efficiency; haptoglobin; swine	SOYBEAN MEAL DIETS; NUTRIENT DIGESTIBILITY; IMMUNE; GALACTOMANNAN; ACTIVATION	The objective was to evaluate the effects of dietary mannan and beta-mannanase supplementation on growth performance and serum acute-phase proteins in nursery pigs. Pigs (n = 480) were blocked by initial body weight (6.6 +/- 0.4 kg), and 12 pens per treatment were randomly assigned to one of four treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement for 28 d. Two levels of dietary mannan (0.4% vs. 2.8%) were offered with and without 0.05% endo-1,4-beta-mannanase. Serum was collected (one pig per pen) for haptoglobin and C-reactive protein (CRP) analysis on days 0 and 28. There were no significant interactions between mannan level and beta-mannanase supplementation. High-mannan diet decreased average daily gain (P = 0.027) and average daily feed intake (P = 0.024) compared with low-mannan diets with no effect of beta-mannanase (P > 0.10). Haptoglobin and CRP were not affected by mannan level or beta-mannanase supplementation (P >= 0.160). Therefore, dietary beta-mannans as high as 2.8% did not induce a systemic innate immune response. Thus, the levels of beta-mannan found in practical diets (<2%) are unlikely to induce an immune response; therefore, supplementation of beta-mannanase to avoid this response is not warranted.

We perform Self-Consistent Field Theory (SCFT) simulations using a finite-element based computational framework (Ackerman et al., 2017), that provides the flexibility to compute equilibrium structures under arbitrary geometries. We consider a sequence of 3D geometries (tetrahedron to sphere) that have the same volume but exhibit varying curvature. This allows us to study the interplay between edge and curvature effects of the 3D geometries on the equilibrium microstructures. We observe that beyond a length scale, the equilibrium structure changes from an interconnected network to a multi-layered concentric shell as the curvature of the 3D geometry is reduced. However, below this length scale the equilibrium structure remains a multi-layered concentric shell independent of curvature. We additionally explore variations in the equilibrium microstructures at a few discrete volume fractions. This study provides insight into possible frustrated phases that can arise in AB diblock systems while varying the shape of confinement geometry.

J	Ditonto, T				Ditonto, Tessa			The Mediating Role of Information Search in the Relationship Between Prejudice and Voting Behavior	POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						correct voting; information search; prejudice; racism; symbolic racism; voting behavior	SYMBOLIC RACISM; BLACK CANDIDATES; WHITE VOTERS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; RACE; PERCEPTIONS; ATTITUDES; STEREOTYPES; IDEOLOGIES; POLITICS	Evidence on the extent to which prejudice serves as a barrier to black and Latino candidates for office is mixed. Some research has found that black and Latino candidates are disadvantaged in terms of their chances of winning election and that they are evaluated differently by voters, while other findings suggest that this may not be the case. This article examines the effects of racial prejudice on candidate evaluation and voting behavior. It uses a unique experimental design to test for direct effects of prejudice on candidate evaluation and voting behavior, as well as indirect effects of prejudice on these variables via the information that subjects seek out. I find that subjects higher in symbolic racism are less likely to vote "correctly" when their preferences most closely align with a black or Latino candidate and that they rate minority candidates more negatively than their white counterparts. I also find that subjects high in prejudice search for less information about minority candidates and that this less robust information search mediates the relationship between prejudice and candidate evaluation and vote measures. Results also suggest that increased information search may mitigate the effects of prejudice on correct voting.

J.; Stromberg, Zachary R.; Van Goor, Angelica; Mellata, Melha			Protection against avian pathogenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella Kentucky exhibited in chickens given both probiotics and live Salmonella vaccine	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						probiotic; Salmonella vaccine; avian pathogenic Escherichia coli; IgY; poultry	VIRULENCE FACTORS; ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; POULTRY; STRAINS; COLIBACILLOSIS; CONTAMINATION; TYPHIMURIUM; ENTERITIDIS; INFECTIONS	Commercial poultry farms are increasingly threatened by bacterial infections from avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) and broad-host Salmonella serovars. Recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccines (RASV) elicit cross-reactive immune responses against APEC in chickens; however, assessment of broad protection is lacking. Probiotics boost chicken immunity and improve vaccination responses. The objective of this study was to determine whether the RASV, the probiotics, or their combination had protection against APEC and Salmonella. White Leghorn chicks were randomly placed into 4 groups: no treatment (CON), probiotics (PRO), RASV (VAX), or both prophylactics (P + V). Chicks in the PRO and P + V groups were fed probiotics daily, beginning at the age of 1-day-old. Chicks in the P+V and VAX groups were orally inoculated with RASV at the age of 4D and boosted 2 wks later. Total and antigen-specific IgY responses to Salmonella (lipolysaccharide [LPS]) and E. coli (IroN and IutA) were measured in serum samples via ELISA. Bactericidal potential of both serum and blood against 42 APEC isolates comprising 25 serotypes was assessed in vitro. In vivo protection against APEC was evaluated by air sac challenge with APEC c7122 (O78:K80), gross pathological lesions were scored, and bacterial loads were enumerated. In a second similar study, birds were orally challenged with S. Kentucky (CVM29188), and feces were enumerated for Salmonella at multiple time points. Vaccination elicited significant LPS-specific antibodies regardless of probiotics (P<0.0001). Chicks in the P+V group demonstrated increased blood and serum bactericidal abilities against multiple APEC strains in vitro compared with the CON group. Following c7122 challenge, P+V birds had less APEC in their blood (P<0.001) and lower signs of airsacculitis (P<0.01) and pericarditis/perihepatitis (P<0.05) than CON birds. Finally, only P + V birds were negative for fecal Salmonella at all time points. This study shows this combination treatment may be a feasible method to reduce infection by APEC and Salmonella in chickens.	[Redweik, Graham A.

However, traditional DEM uses sphere clusters to approximate realistic particles, which is computationally demanding when simulating many particles. This paper demonstrates the potential of using a physics engine technique to simulate realistic particles. The physics engines are originally developed for video games for simulating physical and mechanical processes that occur in the real world to produce realistic game experiences. The simulation accuracy and efficiency of physics engines have been significantly improved in the last two decades allowing them to be used as a scientific tool in many disciplines. This paper introduces modeling methodologies of physics engine including realistic particle representation and the contact model. Then, oedometer tests are simulated using realistic particles scanned by X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT). The simulation results agree well with experimental results. This paper demonstrates that physics engines can output contact parameters for geotechnical analysis and force chains for visualization.

Values of lifelong learners and their pursuits of happiness and whole-person wellness	AGING & MENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						Aging; happiness; orientations to happiness; lifelong learning; whole-person wellness	SATISFACTION	Objectives: In this study, we explored the lived experiences of older adults engaged in lifelong learning programs using the Orientations to Happiness (OTH) framework. Methods: Semi-structured interviews employing a phenomenological approach were conducted with Midwestern older adults (aged 65 years and older) who participated in lifelong learning programs. Interviews were transcribed and collaboratively coded using pattern coding. Results: Six themes were identified that described the values expressed by participants: 1) need for novelty, 2) generativity, 3) spirituality, 4) hedonism, 5) active lifestyle, and 6) family. We created a novel diagram representing the intersectionality of the three OTH components (e.g.meaning, engagement, and pleasure) and explored how the six themes fit within our diagram. In doing so, we elucidated various OTH intersections that highlight a variety of happiness-promoting pathways that lifelong learning programs offer older adults. Discussion: Results suggest that these values and experiences can play an important role in maintaining an engaged lifestyle and providing opportunities for achieving and maintaining happiness and whole-person wellness.

J	MacAllister, A; Kohl, A; Winer, E				MacAllister, Anastacia; Kohl, Adam; Winer, Eliot			Using high-fidelity meta-models to improve performance of small dataset trained Bayesian Networks	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Machine learning; Bayesian Networks; Small datasets; Meta-models; Data generation	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; AUGMENTED REALITY	Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly being used by companies like Google, Amazon and Apple to help identify market trends and predict customer behavior. Continuous improvement and maturing of these ML tools will help improve decision making across a number of industries. Unfortunately, before many ML strategies can be utilized the methods often require large amounts of data. For a number of realistic situations, however, only smaller subsets of data are available (i.e. hundreds to thousands of points). This work explores this problem by investigating the feasibility of using meta-models, specifically Kriging and Radial Basis Functions, to generate data for training a BN when only small amounts of original data are available. This paper details the meta-model creation process and the results of using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for tuning parameters for four network structures trained using three relatively small data sets. Additionally, a series of experiments augment these small datasets by generating ten thousand, one-hundred thousand, and a million synthetic data points using the Kriging and RBF meta-models as well as intelligently establishing prior probabilities using PSO. Results show that augmenting limited existing datasets with meta-model generated data can dramatically affect network accuracy. Overall, the exploratory results presented in this paper demonstrate the feasibility of using meta-model generated data to increase the accuracy of small sample set trained BN. Further developing this method will help underserved areas with access to only small datasets make use of the powerful predictive analytics of ML. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using these contributions in seed production and further development without prior informed consent (PIC) threatens the sustainability of varietal improvement. Procedures other than formal Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) can help prevent unauthorized appropriation but can also be undermined without effective recourse, so prompting the development of formal IPR mechanisms. These comprise "sui generis" systems, specially developed to protect plant varieties per se (Plant Variety Protection or Plant Breeders' Rights) and utility patents. The ultimate goal of IPR is to provide benefits to stakeholders and, ultimately, the public at large. Achieving this goal depends upon balancing the possibility of reward to the developer with benefits that can then flow to others. While not necessarily providing a "silver-bullet," the availability of effective IPR is an important component of business decisions affecting research and product development. Complementarity and individual flexibilities allow tailoring of IPRs to best support agricultural production and societal needs. Research, product development, socioeconomic, and cultural environments are complex, interactive, and dynamic. Consequently, IPRs are subject to scrutiny and change. This review provides examples of these complexities, their influence upon IPRs to date, and upon associations between IPRs and accrual of benefits.

J	Shenk, L				Shenk, Linda			Praising Elizabeth I in Latin at Norwich (1578)	EXPLORATIONS IN RENAISSANCE CULTURE			English	Article						Elizabeth I; Norwich; educated queen; conformity; Anglo-Dutch politics; Anjou		When Elizabeth I visited the city of Norwich, she was publicly praised as a virgin queen for the first time in her reign. Although this image of Elizabeth becomes important to later historiography, this essay argues that there is a more sustained strand of royal myth-making in this visit that gives her even greater independent and specific political authority: that of an educated queen. At Norwich, Elizabeth was addressed more frequently in Latin than during any other visit during her reign, except for her visits to the universities. This essay analyzes the Latin texts to show how Norwich's civic officials used this image to praise Elizabeth as a queen so individually powerful that she should commit more firmly to remaining a distinctly unmarried goddess of wisdom, a champion of Norwich, and the Nurse of God's True (Protestant) Church. What goes unspoken is that she has no need fora foreign Catholic husband in the French Duke of Anjou-the context that underwrites the praise of her as a virgin queen. These Latin texts convey Elizabeth as a queen who has already the specific authority and nurturing care that give her distinctly peaceful nation all it needs to remain strong, prosperous, and religiously unified.

This comparative study of two elementary educators examines their pedagogical approaches to the teaching of Japanese American incarceration as difficult history. Framed by Asian American critical race theory, the teachers' practices revealed challenges in teaching Japanese American incarceration as an example of a difficult history. The author interrogates the role of counternarratives and empathy in teaching difficult histories, particularly with young children, and offers suggestions for pedagogies of discomfort that reveal difficult histories while fostering critical hope.

J	DePaula, G				DePaula, Guilherme			The distributional effect of climate change on agriculture: Evidence from a Ricardian quantile analysis of Brazilian census data	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Distributional effects; Agriculture; Quantile regression; Census data; Brazil	IMPACT; REGRESSION; MODELS; IDENTIFICATION; IRRIGATION; ADAPTATION	The economic impact of global warming likely varies across farms because of differences in climate, technology, and adaptive capacity. Therefore, aggregate estimates of the average effect of warming may be insufficient to model climate change vulnerability. In this study, I propose a quantile model for the distributional effect of climate change. I estimate inter-quantile regressions of land value on climate using agricultural census data for 464,277 commercial farms in Brazil. I find that the effects of climate change in Brazilian agriculture vary significantly by climate, land quality, and irrigation choice. A 1 degrees C of warming is more detrimental to farms in warm climates, those with high-quality land, and those using irrigation. A 10 0-mm decrease in annual precipitation is more damaging to farms in dry climates, those with low-quality land, and those using irrigation. The heterogeneity in climate change effects is particularly large within the subset of farms in the warmest or the driest climates, as the most vulnerable farms appear to be those that have reached their limits for climate adaptation.

Evolution of bubble size distribution, number density, and shape in semi-batch vertical gas-liquid Taylor vortex flow	AICHE JOURNAL			English	Article						bubble phenomena; fluid mechanics; multiphase flow	DIRECT NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; OXYGEN MASS-TRANSFER; 2-PHASE FLOW; EMULSION POLYMERIZATION; MODEL; COEFFICIENT; DIAMETER; BEHAVIOR; STYRENE	Bubble size distribution and bubble ellipticity were measured as a function of axial position in a vertically oriented semi-batch gas-liquid Taylor vortex reactor with varying gas flow rate and inner cylinder rotation speed producing axial Reynolds numbers in the range 23.8-119 and azimuthal Reynolds numbers up to 4.2 x 10(4). The mean bubble size increases monotonically with axial distance from the bottom of the reactor at the location of gas injection. The functional form of the growth of the mean bubble size with axial position depends upon the azimuthal Reynolds number. Specifically, when the azimuthal Reynolds number is less than 1.3 x 10(4), the mean bubble size increases linearly with axial distance from the bubble injection point. In contrast, for azimuthal Reynolds numbers greater than this critical value, the mean bubble size increases with axial distance in a sigmoidal manner.

Design and validation of a frugal, automated, solid-phase peptide synthesizer	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) has enabled widespread use of synthetic peptides in applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to materials science. The demand for synthetic peptides has driven recent efforts to produce automated SPPS synthesizers which utilize fluid-handling components common to chemistry laboratories to drive costs down to several thousand dollars. Herein, we describe the design and validation of a more 'frugal' SPPS synthesizer that uses inexpensive, consumer-grade fluid-handling components to achieve a prototype price point between US$300 and $600. We demonstrated functionality by preparing and characterizing peptides with a variety of distinct properties including binding functionality, nanoscale self-assembly, and oxidation-induced fluorescence. This system yielded micromoles of peptide at a cost of approximately $1/residue, a cost which may be further reduced by optimization and bulk purchasing.

The goal is to optimize the distribution centers' location, the delivery, pickup, and direct shipment routes so that the total costs are minimized. Two types of delivery modes are considered. In the first type, each vehicle loads the same type of products and in the second type, each vehicle is allowed to load multiple types of products. An integrated mixed integer linear programming model was formulated for each delivery type. Computational experiments were conducted to validate the models. Three solution methods: deterministic mode, opportunistic mode, and benders decomposition algorithm in CPLEX have been analyzed.

Molecular imprinting in surfactant micelles with amide cross-linkers provides a convenient one-pot method to prepare nanoparticle receptors for glycosides, glycans, and glycoproteins, taking advantage of hydrogen-bonding interactions near the surfactant/water interface. Biologically competitive micromolar binding affinities were obtained in water and subtle structural differences of glycans could be distinguished.

We find 32 complex reflections of order four generating Gamma. The mirrors of these 32 reflections form the vertices of a sort of Coxeter-Dynkin diagram D whose edges are determined by the finite geometry of 16 points and 16 affine hyperplanes in F-4(2). The group of automorphisms of D is 2(4) : (2(3) : L-3(2)):2. This group transitively permutes the 32 mirrors of generating reflections and fixes a unique point tau in C H-9. These 32 mirrors are precisely the mirrors closest to tau. These results are strikingly similar to the results satisfied by the complex hyperbolic reflection group at the center of Allcock's monstrous proposal.

Shoulder Muscular Fatigue From Static Posture Concurrently Reduces Cognitive Attentional Resources	HUMAN FACTORS			English	Article						peripheral fatigue; cognitive performance; electromyography; laparoscopy	DUAL-TASK; EXERCISE INTENSITY; MUSCLE ENDURANCE; WORK HOURS; PERFORMANCE; DEMANDS; SURGERY; DISTRACTION; PLACEMENT; STRESS	Objective The goal of this work is to determine whether muscular fatigue concurrently reduces cognitive attentional resources in technical tasks for healthy adults. Background Muscular fatigue is common in the workplace but often dissociated with cognitive performance. A corpus of literature demonstrates a link between muscular fatigue and cognitive function, but few investigations demonstrate that the instigation of the former degrades the latter in a way that may affect technical task completion. For example, laparoscopic surgery increases muscular fatigue, which may risk attentional capacity reduction and undermine surgical outcomes. Method A total of 26 healthy participants completed a dual-task cognitive assessment of attentional resources while concurrently statically fatiguing their shoulder musculature until volitional failure, in a similar loading pattern observed in laparoscopic procedures. Continuous and discrete monitoring task performance was recorded to reflect attentional resources. Results Electromyography of the anterior deltoid and descending trapezius, as well as self-assessment surveys indicated fatigue occurrence; continuous tracking error, tracking velocity, and response time significantly increased with muscular fatigue. Conclusion Muscular fatigue concurrently degrades cognitive attentional resources. Application Complex tasks that rely on muscular and cognitive performance should consider interventions to reduce muscular fatigue to also preserve cognitive performance.

J	O'Neill, KC; Lee, YJ				O'Neill, Kelly C.; Lee, Young Jin			Visualizing Genotypic and Developmental Differences of Free Amino Acids in Maize Roots With Mass Spectrometry Imaging	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						mass spectrometry imaging; maize root; amino acids; nitrogen assimilation; nitrogen transportation; on-tissue derivatization	NITROGEN DEFICIENCY; METABOLITES; PLASTIDS; ENZYMES; LIPIDS	Amino acids are essential biological compounds in plants as they store nitrogen, an essential nutrient, and are the building blocks for proteins that drive biological activity. Amino acids have been studied using a wide variety of analytical techniques in different plant systems, however, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a particularly useful technique as it allows for the simultaneous collection of both chemical and spatial information. In this work, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MSI is used to study the different localization of free amino acids in the roots of maize inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal hybrids. Because amino acids are difficult to detect in mass spectrometry, especially directly on tissues, a chemical derivatization protocol is utilized to increase the ionization efficiency and improve their detection. We report differences in both abundance and localization of amino acids in B73 and Mo17 maize roots and suggest the hybrids show evidence of inheriting characteristics from both parents. Most genotypic differences are found in the cross-sections near the seed (similar to 2 cm away) at a later stage of development (10-11 cm in length). Here, B73 has lower amino acid abundance localized primarily to the center of the roots for most amino acids, while Mo17 has much higher abundance localized mainly to the root cortex. This difference in localization is minimized when grown in ammonium ion rich conditions. Roots grown in the presence of N-15-ammonium ions provided additional insight about the amino acid synthesis. The localization of some amino acids, particularly leucine/isoleucine and glutamine, is not affected by the addition of nitrogen and is consistent regardless of the nitrogen source, either from the seeds (N-14-labeled) or environment (N-15-labeled). Nitrogen uptake from the environment is confined to glutamine, asparagine, and alanine, consistent with their roles in amino acid storage and transportation.

Prior to being able to interact with other compounds, tannins have to be extracted from the food matrix, which depends on their chemistry, as well as the chemical structure of other components, such as cell wall material and proteins. Vitis vinifera grapes are commonly grown around the world and are used in winemaking, providing good quality wines with different levels of tannins responsible for the final wine's astringency. Many studies have focused on tannins extractability and retention with cell wall material, and the reactivity of tannins with proteins in Vitis vinifera grapes and wine, but there are very few reports for other Vitis species.

Since 2015, the Affordable Care Act employer mandate has required firms with more than 100 full-time employees to provide health insurance benefits to their employees. We exploit the exogenous increase in ESHI expenses for large firms after the mandate to identify the causal effect of ESHI on firm capital structure. Using COMPUSTAT merged with the Form 5500 data, we find that firms with higher ESHI expenses have higher long-term but lower short-term leverage. That is, accounting for ESHI expenses provides important explanatory power for firm capital structure.

AD is a complex series of biochemical reactions that ultimately result in the formation of biogas, which is a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide with other trace elements. From large installations to small personal reactors, the underlying basic process is the same, but through research, pretreatments and substrate co-digestion are becoming more popular to enhance biogas production. Reactor design and substrate selection also vary depending on the installation's location. Biogas cleaning and upgrading help to increase the usability of the gas for multiple applications. The economic viability depends on the location in the world and the available substrate quality and quantity. AD processes rely heavily on government subsidies to stay profitable. In developing countries, AD profitability is not a concern, as this technology provides a way to better human life in these areas. This review presents a detailed look at the AD technology, provides a discussion on the economics of AD, and suggests future studies to enhance the technology.

The present study evaluates 14 simulated MCSs with 3-, 1- and 0.333-km horizontal grid spacing in order to understand sensitivity in simulated MCS forward propagation speeds and cold pool behavior with decreased grid spacing. MCS cold pools were found to be significantly larger in runs using finer grid spacing. In addition, a greater similarity in solutions occurred when grid spacing was refined to 1 km and less, with 1- and 0.333-km MCS cold pools more similar in magnitude, depth, length, and areal coverage, than 3-km cold pools. The 1-km simulations demonstrated a small increase in forecast skill for 3-h QPF throughout MCS evolution compared to 3-km runs. The 1-km MCS 9-h precipitation swaths were also better aligned with observations compared to 3-km simulations. When evaluating MCS forward propagation speeds, however, 3-km simulated MCS speeds were more similar to observations compared to 1 km.

J	Hassid, J				Hassid, Jonathan			Censorship, the Media, and the Market in China	JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Chinese politics; Comparative politics; Censorship; SASAC; Chinese media	UNCERTAINTY	Pervasive media censorship in China is often seen as a strictly political issue. Although in past years reporters have had leeway to report on economic issues, the Chinese Party/state has moved to tamp down economic journalism, even arresting those who report on bad economic news. This shift brings to the fore an issue long ignored by social scientists - economic censorship. Economic censorship takes place when state-owned enterprises (SOEs) or large private companies pressure the state to censor negative reports or directly pay off media companies to quash such reports in favor of more positive ones. Such economic censorship distorts markets and shifts investor money away from new market entrants and towards large, well-resourced and well-connected SOEs. Using a database of Chinese newspaper articles from 2004 to 2006 and a separate database of newspaper articles, blog posts and micro-blog posts from 2010, and supplemented by secondary sources, this paper examines how media coverage is distorted by censorship and corruption to the benefit of China's entrenched interests. In particular, I find that private and provincially owned companies receive much more press coverage than do their central government (SASAC) owned equivalents, controlling for a number of factors.

Alternating Current Voltammetry at a Bipolar Electrode with Smartphone Luminescence Imaging for Point-of-Need Sensing	CHEMELECTROCHEM			English	Article						alternating current voltammetry; bipolar electrode; electrochemiluminescence; smartphone imaging	ELECTROGENERATED CHEMILUMINESCENCE; AC VOLTAMMETRY; ECL EMISSION; SQUARE-WAVE; SENSOR; PLATFORM; DEVICE; TIME	Bipolar electrochemistry allows for facile arraying of tens to thousands of electrochemical sensors that can be controlled by a single pair of driving electrodes. While bipolar electrodes (BPEs) have been applied to many sensing motifs, their sensitivity and specificity are limited by the lack of diversity in voltammetric methods that have been developed for these wireless electrodes. In this study, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) from the co-oxidation of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and tripropylamine (TPA) is evaluated as a reporting reaction for alternating current voltammetry (ACV) on a BPE at frequencies of 1.0 Hz and 5.0 Hz. We observe sinusoidal alternating luminescence that follows a similar trend to that of the simultaneously monitored current - a plot of the amplitude versus potential approximates a bell-shaped curve. Notably, the luminescent response to the current is detected with a smartphone, which underscores the portability of this method. The fidelity of the transduced signal is determined both in a traditional 3-electrode configuration and at a BPE. These experimental results indicate that the alternating luminescence follows the current sufficiently for quantitative sensing but is diminished at higher frequencies and peaks at a shifted potential. These results are significant because they demonstrate the potential for application of ACV at BPE arrays for multiplexed point-of-need sensors and provide guidance for the selection of reporting reactions in this context.

Herein, we present a protocol for efficient recombinant expression and purification of the human RNA demethylases Alkbh5 and FTO. Our method incorporates a novel fusion tag (the N-terminal domain of bacterial enzyme I, EIN) that dramatically increases the solubility of its fusion partner and is promptly removed upon digestion with a protease. The presented protocol allows for the production of mg amounts of Alkbh5 and FTO in 1L of both rich and minimal media. We developed a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based assay to confirm that both proteins are enzymatically active. Furthermore, the LC-MS method developed here is applicable to other members of the AlkB family of Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. The superior protein yield, afforded by our expression and purification method, will facilitate biochemical investigations into the biological function of the human RNA demethylases and endorse employment of EIN as a broadly applicable fusion tag for recombinant expression projects.

The existing studies, however, have been primarily focused on the intact shear walls, disregarding the possibility of capacity loss due to prior extreme loading events. During windstorms, in particular, windborne debris is the leading cause of damage and destruction. While the impact force induced by windborne debris can directly damage a shear wall, the consequences can become disastrous, as the prior damage adversely affects the in-plane lateral load carrying capacity of the shear wall. This critical aspect motivated the current study to investigate the impact and post-impact performance of wood frame shear walls. For this purpose, a high-fidelity computational framework capable of characterizing both types of damage is developed. Further to providing an in-depth understanding of the process of damage formation and propagatin, this study examines how a range of impact scenarios and wall design factors influence the extent of damage that the wood frame shear walls experience in a windstorm. The outcome of this study is then employed to introduce a capacity loss index for the multi-hazard design and assessment of wood frame (and other similar) shear walls in the regions prone to severe windstorms.

Studies have shown that the effectiveness of CIR depends on its milling depth, and in order for agencies to better decide the pavement design, depth of CIR to be milled and placed, the authors have developed a procedure to back-calculate the structural layer coefficient of CIR layers based on performance data, in order to evaluate their structural capacity. This paper attempts to establish a relation between the structural capacity of the CIR layer and the international roughness index (IRI) of the pavement over time, using the results of previous research determining a definite differential between the IRI of pavements with different CIR thicknesses.

PLANT DIRECT			English	Article						alpha-tocopherol; freeze-thaw injury; glutathione; in situ freezing test; proline; reactive oxygen species	COLD-ACCLIMATION; THAW INJURY; LIGNIN BIOSYNTHESIS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL; SALICYLIC-ACID; BRASSICA-NAPUS; CELL-WALLS; METABOLISM; GROWTH	Freeze-thaw stress is one of the major environmental constraints that limit plant growth and reduce productivity and quality. Plants exhibit a variety of cellular dysfunctions following freeze-thaw stress, including accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This means that enhancement of antioxidant capacity by exogenous application of antioxidants could potentially be one of the strategies for improving freezing tolerance (FT) of plants. Exogenous application of ascorbic acid (AsA), as an antioxidant, has been shown to improve plant tolerance against abiotic stresses but its effect on FT has not been investigated. We evaluated the effect of AsA-feeding on FT of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) at whole plant and excised-leaf level, and conducted metabolite profiling of leaves before and after AsA treatment to explore metabolic explanation for change in FT. AsA application did not impede leaf growth, instead slightly promoted it. Temperature-controlled freeze-thaw tests revealed AsA-fed plants were more freezing tolerant as indicated by: (a) less visual damage/mortality; (b) lower ion leakage; and (c) less oxidative injury, lower abundance of free radicals (O2 center dot- and H2O2). Comparative leaf metabolite profiling revealed clear separation of metabolic phenotypes for control versus AsA-fed leaves. Specifically, AsA-fed leaves had greater abundance of antioxidants (AsA, glutathione, alpha- & gamma-tocopherol) and compatible solutes (proline, galactinol, and myo-inositol). AsA-fed leaves also had higher activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, and catalase). These changes, together, may improve FT via alleviating freeze-induced oxidative stress as well as protecting membranes from freeze desiccation. Additionally, improved FT by AsA-feeding may potentially include enhanced cell wall/lignin augmentation and bolstered secondary metabolism as indicated by diminished level of phenylalanine and increased abundance of branched amino acids, respectively.

Effect of grain size and grain size distribution on slip dynamics: An experimental analysis	TECTONOPHYSICS			English	Article						Gouge; Grain-size-distribution; Slip dynamics; Analog modeling; Granular mechanics; Rheology and friction of fault zones	SAN-ANDREAS FAULT; STICK-SLIP; DEFORMATION; CATACLASIS; DILATANCY; CLASSIFICATION; SIMULATIONS; KINEMATICS; FRICTION; PACKING	When faults form and slip they produce granular wear material that accommodates most of the strain. We investigate the effect of grain size and grain size distribution on slip dynamics by using sheared elliptical acrylic discs as a fault gouge proxy. Physical experiments on three different grain size assemblages are performed in a spring slider apparatus. Our results indicate that below a grain diameter threshold of 1/10 of the shear zone width, increasing grain size corresponds to faster slip velocities during slip events. In experiments with more than one grain size, the relative proportions of grain sizes and effective grain sizes control the bulk behavior. We show that shear zones with grains that are larger than 1/10 of the shear zone width show deformation dynamics that are independent of the small grain fraction. In shear zones where the grain sizes are below this threshold a high abundance of small grains promotes slower and smaller slip events.

Previous work has demonstrated that this interface comes at a spatial cognitive cost - though, upon closer inspection, not everyone appears similarly affected. A latent profile analysis identified three groups that significantly differed on spatial updating performance and follow-up analyses showed significant differences in objective measures of spatial ability (e.g., mental rotation and perspective-taking). These results suggest that there are individual differences in domains of spatial cognition that are related to how well a user may keep track of his or her location while teleporting in VR.

However, blockchain mining processes demand high hardware costs and consume a vast amount of energy (studies have shown that the amount of energy consumed in Bitcoin mining is almost the same as the electricity used in Ireland). To address the high mining cost problem of blockchain networks, in this paper, we propose a blockchain mining resources allocation algorithm to reduce the mining cost in PoW-based (proof-of-work- based) blockchain networks. We first propose an analytical queueing model for general blockchain networks. In our queueing model, transactions arrive randomly to the queue and are served in a batch manner with unknown service rate probability distribution and agnostic to any priority mechanism. Then, we leverage the Lyapunov optimization techniques to propose a dynamic mining resources allocation algorithm (DMRA), which is parameterized by a tuning parameter K > 0. We show that our algorithm achieves an [O(1/K), O(K)] cost-optimality-gap-vs-delay tradeoff. Our simulation results also demonstrate the effectiveness of DMRA in reducing mining costs.

The novelty of the study lies in modeling multiple uncertainties using two-stage stochastic programming to solve a kitting specific production planning problem in a manufacturing setting. The demand for the kits and the yield of the kitting workers are the two sources of uncertainties considered in this study. The first-stage decisions include the baseline production schedule and the workforce requirement, while the second stage makes recourse decisions on overtime production. The proposed decision-making framework is validated on a multi-period, multi-product case study involving a kitting facility supporting a manufacturing plant producing braking equipment. The main conclusion of the study is that uncertainties have significant impacts on kitting planning decisions and that the proposed two-stage stochastic programming model was robust in determining optimal production plans under uncertainty.

Across three studies, this research finds that social factors play an important role in determining the perceptions that these consumers have about their food situation. When reminded about their social networks, low-income consumers report higher levels of food availability. However, this effect holds only if social cohesion is high, indicating that social cohesion acts as a moderator. Another moderator of perceived food availability is the distance at which the social networks are located. When social networks are near (same city), strong and weak social relationships help increase perceptions of food availability. However, when the geographic distance increases (different city), only strong social relationships help. This research finds that self-confidence explains the reason why social factors affect perceived food availability.

B	McKinney, E; Wei, BY		Moore, JG		McKinney, Ellen; Wei, Bingyue			Patternmaking Methods for Creating Size-Adjustable Garments	PATTERNMAKING HISTORY AND THEORY			English	Article; Book Chapter								In this chapter the authors explore the concept of making a pattern that produces a product that can be adapted by consumers to change the size and/or the style. The chapter commences by detailing the ways garments have been made adjustable and the patternmaking methods that have been used to create size-adjustable garments. The authors explore the types of garments and garment parts that have been made adjustable for both length and circumference, detail the methods that have been implemented for creating adjustability, and note whether each approach resulted in an adaptation that was permanent or reversible. This discussion reveals not only a specific kind of approach to patternmaking but also points to the ability of a patternmaker to address fit issues that exist among customers who have bodies of differing sizes and encourages the reader to consider the challenges of creating an exceptional fit in a different way. Finally, the authors note that exploring the possibilities of adjustable garments has the potential to advance the agenda of sustainability by prolonging the use of clothes that can be adjusted for size over the span of their use. This contribution to the volume introduces a concept that is not specifically dealt with elsewhere in this text, however it does speak to the idea that a given pattern (be it a commercial paper pattern or a pattern hand-drafted from a block or using CAD technology) can be modified by the designer or the user to accommodate specific stylistic or size requirements. This subset of patternmaking (pattern modification) can be explored for both creative intentions as well as to solve more workaday problems of necessity by both home sewers and professional patternmakers.

Crossover Dynamics of Culex (Diptera: Culicidae) Vector Populations Determine WNV Transmission Intensity	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Culex crossover; West Nile virus transmission; mosquito surveillance	WEST-NILE-VIRUS; PIPIENS DIPTERA; RESTUANS DIPTERA; CLIMATIC FACTORS; UNITED-STATES; MOSQUITOS; ABUNDANCE; IDENTIFICATION; SURVEILLANCE; TEMPERATURE	First introduced into the United States in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) has become endemic and has established itself as the predominant mosquito-borne arbovirus in North America.Transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Culex, regional landscapes influence local vector species abundance, creating different mosquito ecologies that drive local transmission dynamics. In central Iowa, two mosquito species, Culex restuans Theobald and Culex pipiens Linnaeus, serve as the predominant mosquito vectors. Importantly, these mosquito populations are influenced by seasonal patterns in their abundance, with Cx. restuans preferring cool, early spring temperatures, while Cx. pipiens prefer the warmer, mid- to late-summer months. The point of the season at which Cx. pipiens becomes the dominant species is generally referred to as a 'crossover' period. To better understand the influence of crossover dynamics on WNV transmission, we examined environmental and mosquito abundance data, as well as mosquito infection rates and human disease cases from 2016 to 2018. We demonstrate that temperature influences the timing and duration of the crossover period, influencing mosquito abundance and human disease transmission.Together, these results suggest that Culex species crossover is an important variable of WNV transmission dynamics, which may provide an early warning indicators of increased WNV transmission.

Image-Based Feedback Control for a Coaxial Spray	JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						coaxial two-fluid spray; flow control; shadowgraph imaging	LIQUID JET	Optimization of jet engine sprays has the potential to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Sprays can be continually optimized in multivariate scenarios using real-time feedback control, but a method of controlling the sprays based on physical properties must first be established. In this study, a spray controller was developed to optimize the spray angle obtained from shadowgraphs, with the assumption that the largest angle is desired. The spray angle was used as an example, as it is a physically important parameter which is easily found through shadowgraph imaging. Varying ratios of swirled air to straight air, determined by the image-based feedback controller were introduced into the air portion of a coaxial airblast nozzle while keeping the total air flow rate constant. A golden section search converged on the swirled air ratio that provided the largest angle and was validated from the distribution of spray angle versus swirled air ratio. The ratio that produced a spray with the greatest angle of 25.8 +/- 2deg was found at a swirled air ratio of 0.66 +/- 0.03 for a spray with a momentum ratio of 6. The successful design and implementation of this image-based feedback controller is intended to provide a foundation for developing real-time active feedback controllers for sprays.

A better understanding of the plant cell wall polysaccharide content, distribution, and interactions among them could be instrumental for our further understanding of plant cell wall in general. Confocal Raman microscopy (CRM) is a powerful tool that could reveal details about chemical landscape of the plant cell wall with micrometer resolution. However, the low signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of Raman spectral signal led to low throughput of Raman imaging, which limited its application in plant cell wall study. In this study, the interaction between the cell wall polysaccharides and the pectin enzyme endo-polygalacturonase (EPG) was characterized by analyzing Raman images collected before and after EPG treatment at high scanning speed. The obtained low S/N ratio Raman spectra were processed with principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) to recover information-rich signature changes in Raman signal dataset that reflected the changes in the polysaccharides caused specifically by the enzymatic hydrolysis. The PCA reconstruction technique significantly improved the S/N ratio of the spectra dataset while kept the Raman signal intact. Further analysis of principal components (PCs) revealed the pectin distribution and its interaction with the enzyme, which provided organizational details of pectin inside the onion plant cell wall. The technique could be used to reveal polysaccharide organization and distribution inside plant cell walls.

Automated classification of bacterial cell sub-populations with convolutional neural networks	PLOS ONE			English	Article							IMAGE-ANALYSIS	Quantification of phenotypic heterogeneity present amongst bacterial cells can be a challenging task. Conventionally, classification and counting of bacteria sub-populations is achieved with manual microscopy, due to the lack of alternative, high-throughput, autonomous approaches. In this work, we apply classification-type convolutional neural networks (cCNN) to classify and enumerate bacterial cell sub-populations (B. subtilis clusters). Here, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the cCNN developed in this study can be as high as 86% when trained on a relatively small dataset (81 images). We also developed a new image preprocessing algorithm, specific to fluorescent microscope images, which increases the amount of training data available for the neural network by 72 times. By summing the classified cells together, the algorithm provides a total cell count which is on parity with manual counting, but is 10.2 times more consistent and 3.8 times faster. Finally, this work presents a complete solution framework for those wishing to learn and implement cCNN in their synthetic biology work.

J	Schaal, M				Schaal, Michele			From actions to words: FEMEN's fourth-wave manifestos	FRENCH CULTURAL STUDIES			English	Article						democracy; FEMEN; fourth-wave feminism; global feminism; intersectionality; manifestos; women&#8217; s rights	BODY	Since its creation in 2008 in Ukraine, FEMEN has fascinated mainstream audiences and scholars alike. Yet few studies have dealt with FEMEN's writings in French. While the lack of translations may partially explain this critical gap, the overall dismissal of FEMEN and its impact on contemporary feminisms participates in the historic marginalisation of women's contributions to the arts, the sciences, or society at large. Recognising the organisation's problematic standpoints, this article demonstrates how, going from action to words, FEMEN's collective book publications, Manifeste FEMEN and Rebellion, contribute to, and complicate, contemporary feminist thought and debates. Inscribing themselves in the feminist manifesto tradition, both books articulate a fourth-wave feminist standpoint, and through FEMEN's assessment of their actions, the organisation unveils Western democracies' tartufferies regarding secularism and equal rights. FEMEN's manifestos also generate a reflection on the (im)possibility of a universal, global approach to feminism, namely, due to their Islamophobic stances.

Despite the past studies on the strength, shrinkage, and hydration of shrinkage-compensating cement concretes, there was no systematic investigation to understand the performance of this type of concrete under exposure to aggressive agents, particularly chloride ions. To address this gap, a holistic testing program was established in this study to evaluate the strength, dimensional stability, and transport properties of concretes made with various dosages of Type K expansive agent. This included compressive strength, drying shrinkage, rapid chloride penetration, electrical resistivity, rapid chloride migration, and absorption tests. Both helium and mercury intrusion porosimetry analyses were also performed to further explain the experimental test results with the findings related to the distribution of pores. The results of this study confirmed the benefits of using Type K expansive agent (up to a certain dosage) in terms of increased compressive strength and reduced drying shrinkage. However, it was revealed that the permeability of concretes made with this type of cement is adversely affected. This issue was addressed by the identification of optimal dosages of supplementary cementitious materials, including fly ash and silica fume. Upon completing the necessary experiments on the improved mixtures, this study reported how low-shrinkage concretes with low susceptibility to chloride penetration can be developed with the promise of application in a wide variety of civil infrastructures exposed to harsh environmental conditions.

Elucidating energy scaling between atomic and molecular adsorbates in the presence of solvent	AICHE JOURNAL			English	Article						condensed phase; density functional theory; heterogeneous catalysis; molecular dynamics; transition metals	DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; WATER; ADSORPTION; METHANOL; INTERFACES; INSIGHTS; CO; DECOMPOSITION; CONVERSION; OXIDATION	Condensed phase reactions have recently attracted increased interest, but principles for efficiently screening and designing catalyst materials through computations are lacking. In this study, we examine the applicability of energy correlations between adsorbed surface species, which have been instrumental in accelerating the computational design of catalyst materials in gas-phase contexts, in various representations of a condensed phase reaction environment. We perform detailed density functional theory calculations of the adsorption of atomic and molecular species in the presence of various representations of solvent species. Our results show that the well-known scaling in the gas phase context is preserved, with scaling slopes unaffected by the adsorbate-liquid interactions. Moreover, these results hold when changing surface structure, solvent identity, and even in highly disordered environments. We envision the establishment of an energy scaling framework for condensed phase reactions to accelerate catalyst discovery and design in those contexts.

J	Emaus, MN; Anderson, JL				Emaus, Miranda N.; Anderson, Jared L.			Allelic discrimination between circulating tumor DNA fragments enabled by a multiplex-qPCR assay containing DNA-enriched magnetic ionic liquids	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						DNA extraction; Cell-free DNA; Multiplex PCR; Magnetic ionic liquid	CELL-FREE-DNA; COLORECTAL-CANCER PATIENTS; DOUBLE-STRANDED-DNA; ABUNDANCE MUTATIONS; DIRECT EXTRACTION; PCR; AMPLIFICATION; SOLVENTS; PLASMA; KRAS	Multiplex amplification of DNA can be highly valuable in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis due to the sheer number of potential mutations. However, commercial ctDNA extraction methods struggle to preconcentrate low concentrations of DNA and require multiple sample handling steps. Recently, magnetic ionic liquids (MILs) have been used to extract DNA and were integrated with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). However, in previous studies, DNA could not be preconcentrated from plasma and only one fragment could be amplified per reaction. In this study, MILs were utilized as DNA extraction solvents and directly integrated into a multiplex-qPCR buffer to simultaneously amplify wild-type KRAS, G12S KRAS, and wild-type BRAF, three clinically-relevant genes whose mutation status can affect the success of anti-EGFR therapy. DNA was desorbed from the MIL solvent during a multiplex-PCR without having a significant effect on the amplification efficiency, and allelic discrimination of single-nucleotide polymorphisms could still be achieved. Enrichment factors over 35 for all three sequences were achieved from Tris buffer using the [N-8,8,8,Bz(+)][Ni(hfacac)(3)(-)]) and [P-6,6,6,14(+)][Ni(Phtfacac)(3)(-)] MILs. DNA could still be preconcentrated from 2-fold diluted human plasma using the [N-8,8,8,Bz(+)][Ni(hfacac)(3)(-)] MIL. Extractions from undiluted plasma were reproducible with the [P-6,6,6,14(+)][Ni(Phtfacac)(3)(-)] MIL although DNA was not preconcentrated with enrichment factors around 0.6 for all three fragments. Compared to commercial DNA extraction methods (i.e., silica-based spin columns and magnetic beads), the MIL-based extraction achieved higher enrichment factors in Tris buffer and plasma. The ability of the MIL-based dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) direct-multiplex-qPCR method to simultaneously achieve high enrichment factors of multiple DNA fragments from human plasma is highly promising in the field of ctDNA detection.

Inhibition of germinal vesicle breakdown using IBMX increases microRNA-21 in the porcine oocyte	REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY AND ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Oocyte; Germinal vesicle breakdown; microRNA; MIR21	IN-VITRO MATURATION; MEIOTIC MATURATION; ENDOGENOUS SIRNAS; NUCLEAR EXPORT; SMALL RNAS; CAMP; COMPLEX; PHOSPHODIESTERASES; IDENTIFICATION; MIR-21	Background Germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) occurs during oocyte meiotic maturation, a period when transcriptional processes are virtually inactive. Thus, the maturing oocyte is reliant on processes such as post-transcriptional gene regulation (PTGR) to regulate the mRNA and protein repertoire. MicroRNA (miRNA) are a class of functional small RNA that target mRNA to affect their abundance and translational efficiency. Of particular importance is miRNA-21 (MIR21) due to its role in regulating programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4). The objective of this study was to characterize the abundance and regulation of MIR21 in relation to GVBD. Methods Oocytes were collected from aspirated porcine tertiary follicles. Relative abundance of mature MIR21 was quantified at 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 42 h of in vitro (IVM) with or without treatment with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Results IBMX increased abundance of MIR21 at 24 h approximately 30-fold compared to control oocytes (P < 0.05), and the induced increase in MIR21 abundance at 24 h was concomitant with premature depletion of PDCD4 protein abundance. To characterize the effect of artificially increasing MIR21 on oocyte competence without inhibiting GVBD, a MIR21 mimic, scrambled microRNA negative control, or nuclease free water was micro-injected into denuded oocytes at 21 h of IVM. The maturation rate of oocytes injected with synthetic MIR21 (63.0 +/- 7.5%) was higher than oocytes injected with negative controls (P < 0.05). Conclusions Inhibition of nuclear meiotic maturation via IBMX significantly increased MIR21 and decreased its target, PDCD4. Injection of a MIR21 mimic increased oocyte maturation rate. Our results indicate MIR21 is active and important during meiotic maturation of the oocyte.

Evaluation of Size-Selective Predation on Age-0 Walleye	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article							STIZOSTEDION-VITREUM-VITREUM; LARGEMOUTH BASS PREDATION; PREY SIZE; GASTRIC LAVAGE; BODY-SIZE; SURVIVAL; VULNERABILITY; REGRESSION; ONTOGENY; SUCCESS	The success of fish stocking programs is dependent on poststocking survival. However, survival can be influenced by size-selective mortality, where larger individuals are expected to be less vulnerable to predation. Walleye Sander vitreus is a commonly stocked sport fish, but little is known regarding the role of size-selective predation on age-0 Walleye (90-290 mm TL) that are stocked in the presence of various piscivores with different foraging strategies and morphological features. Our objective was to evaluate whether the TL of consumed age-0 Walleye was related to predator TL, predator gape height, or the probability of predation. We also assessed whether length distributions varied among stocked, recaptured, and consumed age-0 Walleye. Data for the food habits of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, Smallmouth Bass M. dolomieu, Northern Pike Esox lucius, adult Walleye, and Muskellunge Esox masquinongy were collected from East Okoboji Lake and West Okoboji Lake, Iowa, USA during fall 2015-2017. Over the course of the study, 301 age-0 Walleye were recovered from 3,514 predator stomachs. Mean, maximum (85th percentile), and minimum (15th percentile) TL of the consumed age-0 Walleye were not related to the TL or gape height of the predators (P > 0.05), but the probability of predation decreased by 0.02 for every 10-mm increase in the TL of the age-0 Walleye. The length distributions indicated that consumed Walleye were generally smaller, whereas recaptured Walleye tended to be larger than stocked fish were. Our approach to evaluating poststocking size-selective predation on age-0 Walleye furthers the current understanding of the importance of size at stocking relative to stocking success and suggests that stocking Walleye > 220 mm is economically advantageous for reducing predation risk.

Herein, rare-earth tetramethylaluminate complexes are shown to catalyze the exclusive C-H bond metalation of terminal alkynes with the commodity reagents trimethyl-, triethyl-, and triisobutylaluminum. Kinetic experiments probing alkyl-group exchange between rare-earth aluminates and trialkylaluminum, C-H bond metalation of alkynes, and catalytic conversions reveal distinct pathways of catalytic aluminations with triethylaluminum versus trimethylaluminum. Most significantly, kinetic data point to reversible formation of a unique [Ln](AlR4)(2).AlR3 adduct, followed by turnover-limiting alkyne metalation. That is, C-H bond activation occurs from a more associated organometallic species, rather than the expected coordinatively unsaturated species. These mechanistic conclusions allude to a new general strategy for catalytic C-H bond alumination that make use of highly electrophilic metal catalysts.

BOULARDII; DOUBLE-BLIND; THERAPY; INFLAMMATION; PREVENTION; EXPRESSION; INFECTION	The presence of commensal fungal species in the human gut indicates that organisms from this kingdom have the potential to benefit the host as well. Saccharomyces boulardii, a yeast strain isolated about a hundred years ago, is the most well-characterized probiotic yeast. Though for the most part it genetically resembles Saccharomyces cerevisiae, specific phenotypic differences make it better suited for the gut microenvironment such as better acid and heat tolerance. Several studies using animal hosts suggest that S. boulardii can be used as a biotherapeutic in humans. Clinical trials indicate that it can alleviate symptoms from gastrointestinal (GI) tract infections to some extent, but further trials are needed to understand the full therapeutic potential of S. boulardii. Improvement on probiotic function using engineered yeast is an attractive future direction, though genome modification tools for use in S. boulardii have been limited until recently. However, some tools available for S. cerevisiae should be applicable for S. boulardii as well. In this review, we summarize the observed probiotic effect of this yeast and the state of the art for genome engineering tools that could help enhance its probiotic properties.

J	Wi, K; Suresh, V; Wang, KJ; Li, BW; Qin, HT				Wi, Kwangwoo; Suresh, Vignesh; Wang, Kejin; Li, Beiwen; Qin, Hantang			Quantifying quality of 3D printed clay objects using a 3D structured light scanning system	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						3D printing; Printing quality; Structured light system; 3D scan; Geometry	VISION SYSTEM; CONCRETE; CAMERA	Three-dimensional (3D) printing, or additive manufacturing, has been increasingly used in many fields, including the medicine, food, sensing, metal, automotive, and construction industries. Regardless of its growing applications, there are few of methods, guidelines, and specifications for measuring and quantifying the qualifies of 3D printed objects. This is particularly so for objects those are too small, too large, and/or too fragile to be handled manually. In this study, for the first time, a non-contact, and non-destructive measurement method, a 3D structured light scanning system (3D-SLSS), was employed for evaluating the printing qualifies of clay objects with different levels of visual defects (e.g., roughness and distortion). 3D scanned images of these clay samples were developed using 3D-SLSS. Then, they were sliced along their sides (perpendicular to the base) to generate a number of two-dimensional (2D) plots, from which various parameters (e.g., sample total height [H-tota(l)], outer diameter [DMouter], layer thickness [T-L] layer width, [(W-L], surface angle [S-alpha]semi-cross-sectional area [X-A], and surface roughness [R]) were measured. These measurements were then compared with the designed values. The percentages of the differences between the measured and designed values were used to develop a diagnosed area of deficiency, by which the overall qualifies of the printed samples were quantified. The results illustrated that all the printed samples exhibited certain differences between their measured and designed values, even for those that appeared well printed. Compared with the designed object, the printed samples generally had reduced total height, diameter, and layer thickness; increased layer width; measurable distortion; and visible surface roughness. Many of these were largely because the freshly printed clay deformed under the weight of the layers above. The distortion angle and area are two necessary parameters for quantifying the degree of distortion of a printed sample. The diagnosed area of deficiency can well describe the overall qualifies of the printed samples. 3D-SLSS is a relatively simple, fast, and inexpensive characterization method. Moreover, it can be conveniently extended to various industries for quality control of diverse 3D printing products.

A reproducible method of establishing latent fingerprint age would allow forensic personnel to determine if a latent fingerprint was relevant to a crime. This work investigates the ambient aging of triacylglycerols (TGs) and other lipids in latent fingerprint residue utilizing matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging. Unsaturated TGs were found to undergo ambient ozonolysis resulting in a decrease over time. At the same time, two series of compounds related to the degradation of unsaturated TGs due to ambient ozonolysis emerged with time and were detectable within a single day of aging. Tracking the degradation of unsaturated TGs over time proved to be relatively reproducible in multiple individuals and is suggested as a means of establishing latent fingerprint age.

Post-emergence land rolling influences soybean plant architecture but not yield	CROP FORAGE & TURFGRASS MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Increasing the number of nodes for subsequent pod development by soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] may be an approach to improve yield. Land rolling is a common practice in soybean production to push rocks and corn (Zea mays L.) root halls back to the soil surface to protect combine harvesters. Limited research has been done to determine if land rolling can change plant architecture by breaking the apical dominance of soybean to induce lateral branching and provide greater node and pod numbers. The objective of this experiment was to determine if land rolling soybeans could break apical dominance to induce lateral branching, increase reproductive node number, and improve yield. Field experiments were conducted in 2017 and 2018 in a randomized complete block design with five replications. Treatments consisted of a control that was not rolled, rolling beforeemergence, and rolling at the V2, V3, and V4 stages of development. Data included counts of main stems and branches, nodes on main stems, branches that did or did not have pods, pod numbers on main stems and branches, stand density, and grain yield. Land rolling decreased main stem numbers, and reproductive nodes and pods on main stems. Land rolling soybean after emergence consistently decreased stand density in 2018 but only decreased stand density on one of three post-emergence timings in 2017. However, land rolling did not influence branch numbers or branch nodes and pods. Land rolling influenced soybean plant architecture but did not influence yield when done before or after emergence.

Measuring the Impact of Influence on Individuals: Roadmap to Quantifying Attitude	2020 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM)	Proceedings of the IEEE-ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)	DEC 07-10, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, Assoc Comp Machinery, IEEE Comp Soc, ACM SIGKDD, IEEE TCDE, Springer, Elsevier			INFLUENCE MAXIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS	Influence diffusion has been central to the study of the propagation of information in social networks, where influence is typically modeled as a binary property of entities: influenced or not influenced. We introduce the notion of attitude, which, as described in social psychology, is the degree by which an entity is influenced by the information. We present an information diffusion model that quantifies the degree of influence, i.e., attitude of individuals, in a social network. With this model, we formulate and study the attitude maximization problem. We prove that the function for computing attitude is monotonic and sub-modular, and the attitude maximization problem is NP-Hard. We present a greedy algorithm for maximization with an approximation guarantee of (1 - 1/epsilon). Using the same model, we also introduce the notion of "actionable" attitude with the aim to study the scenarios where attaining individuals with high attitude is objectively more important than maximizing the attitude of the entire network. We show that the function for computing actionable attitude, unlike that for computing attitude, is non-submodular but is approximately submodular. We present an approximation algorithm for maximizing actionable attitude in a network. We experimentally evaluated our algorithms and studied empirical properties of the attitude of nodes in the network such as spatial and value distribution of high attitude nodes.

Since the modern wind farms are integrated with active sensors and controllable actuators, coupled with the legacy infrastructure, for wide-area applications, it is imperative to address the associated cybersecurity challenges in the context of SCADA-based wind farm infrastructure. In this paper, we present a testbed-based performance evaluation of attack-resilient control for wind farm SCADA system (WFSS) that detects different cyber attacks on the SCADA measurement, and provide necessary mitigation using the forecast information. Specifically, we have utilized the real-time wind power forecast, as a redundant measurement, and timing property of SCADA measurements to develop model-based anomaly detector. Once an anomaly is detected, wind power forecast information is leveraged, as a part of a mitigation system, for monitoring and control purposes. We have leveraged the resources available at Iowa State University's PowerCyber testbed to implement cyberattacks and later validate the performance of attack resilient control. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed rules-based ADMS is efficient in detecting several cyber attacks, and further mitigating them to maintain system stability and reliability.

In its initial aftermath, and as we contemplate a potential reignition, the food supply chain industries, researchers, and policy makers search for evidence, causes, and consequences. This article uses publicly available data on the pork and egg industries and a survey of the turkey industry as a first step to document the impact of COVID-19. Researchers can learn from the experiences in industries where disruptions evolve differently in the face of simultaneous supply- and demand-side shocks and that stem from differences in structures of the supply chains. This early evidence is used to motivate future research needs and highlight opportunities for industry investments in resiliency strategies.

J	Kuhlmann, D				Kuhlmann, Daniel			Upzoning and Single-Family Housing Prices A (Very) Early Analysis of the Minneapolis 2040 Plan	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION			English	Article						housing prices; land use; zoning	LAND-USE REGULATIONS; HISTORIC PRESERVATION; PROPERTY-VALUES; GENTRIFICATION; NEIGHBORHOODS; AMERICAN; MARKETS; IMPACT	Problem, research strategy, and findings In December 2018, the Minneapolis (MN) city council approved a new comprehensive plan that proposed eliminating single-family zoning restrictions throughout the city. In this project, I study the initial impact of this change on the sales prices of affected housing units. I estimate a series of difference-in-differences models comparing the sales price of houses within 3 km of the Minneapolis border in the year before and year after the city adopted the plan. I find that compared with similar unaffected properties in surrounding cities, the Minneapolis plan change was associated with a 3% and 5% increase in the price of affected housing units. In addition, there is some evidence that this price increase is due to the new development option it offers property owners. I find that the plan-related price increases are larger in inexpensive neighborhoods and for properties that are small relative to their immediate neighbors. Takeaway for practice By examining the short-term effect of the Minneapolis 2040 Plan's elimination of single-family zoning, my study is useful for planners working in cities considering similar reforms. My analysis, though preliminary, suggests that there is indeed demand for denser development in the city. But the price increases associated with the upzoning redounds most directly to relatively small properties and those in inexpensive neighborhoods. Planners should thus be sensitive to how this type of change can affect housing affordability and housing stock diversity.

A quadrature-based conditional moment closure for mixing-sensitive reactions	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Mixing-sensitive reactions; Conditional moment closure; Quadrature based-solution algorithm; Turbulent mixing	PROBABILITY DENSITY-FUNCTION; TURBULENT; SCALAR; MODEL	A novel algorithm consisting of a quadrature-based semi-analytical solution to the conditional moment closure (CMC) is developed for mixing-sensitive reactions in turbulent flows. When applying the proposed algorithm, the additional grid in mixture-fraction phase space used in CMC codes is eliminated, and at most ten quadrature nodes are needed to model mixing-sensitive turbulent reacting flows. In this work, the mixture-fraction probability density function (PDF) is assumed to be a beta-PDF, which is the weight function for the Gauss-Jacobi quadrature rule. The conditional moments of reacting species are determined from unconditional moments that are first order with respect to the species and higher order with respect to mixture fraction. Here, the focus is on the efficient treatment of the molecular-mixing step by using a semi-analytical solution in the form of a Jacobi polynomial expansion.

Supportive evidence is provided for distribution systems populated by households with smart electric heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. The optimal form of a household's bid function is first derived from dynamic programming principles, based solely on the household's general thermal dynamic and welfare attributes. The quantitative form of this optimal bid function is then explicitly derived, given quantitative forms for these attributes. A method is also developed for the systematic construction of household types based on these attributes. Bid comparison, peak load reduction, and target load matching test cases conducted for a 123-bus distribution system illustrate the usefulness of these methods for ensuring bid-based transactive energy system designs are able to align system goals and constraints with local customer goals and constraints.

Technol.12, 149-154; Case 2017Mater. Eval.75). However, sustained activities in this field date back to the early 1980s (Zoughi 1995Res. Nondestr. Eval.7, 71-74; Zoughi 2018Mater. Eval.76, 1051-1057; Kharkovsky 2007IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Magazine10, 26-38). Owing to various limitations associated with using microwaves and millimetre waves for NDT&E, these techniques did not see much utility in the early days. However, with the advent and prevalence of composite materials and structures, in a wide range of applications, and technological advances in high-frequency component design and availability, these techniques are no longer considered as 'emerging techniques' (Zoughi 2018Mater. Eval.76, 1051-1057; Schull 2002Nondestructive evaluation: theory, techniques, and applications). Currently, microwave and millimetre-wave NDT&E is a rapidly growing field and has been more widely acknowledged and accepted by practitioners over the last 25+ years (Case 2017Mater. Eval.75; Bakhtiari 1994IEEE Trans. Microwave Theory Tech.42, 389-395; Bakhtiari 1993Mater. Eval.51, 740-743; Bakhtiari 1993IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas.42, 19-24; Ganchev 1995IEEE Trans. Instrum.

Microwave non-destructive testing was recently recognized and designated by the American Society for Nondestructive Testing (ASNT) as a 'Method' on its own (Case 2017Mater. Eval.75). These techniques are well suited for materials characterization; layered composite inspection for thickness, disbond, delamination and corrosion under coatings; surface-breaking crack detection and evaluation; and cure-state monitoring in concrete and resin-rich composites, to name a few. This work reviews recent advances in four major areas of microwave and millimetre-wave NDT&E, namely materials characterization, surface crack detection, imaging and sensors. The techniques, principles and some of the applications in each of these areas are discussed.

Reliability assessment of scenarios generated for stock index returns incorporating momentum	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE & ECONOMICS			English	Article						index return; momentum; scenario generation; scenario reliability assessment; volatility	PORTFOLIO; VERIFICATION	Stochastic programming models for portfolio optimization rely on scenario paths for returns derived from stochastic process models. This paper investigates a variant of the geometric Brownian motion process for stock index returns that incorporates index momentum. Based on this model, three different processes for generating scenarios on a rolling basis are devised, which differ according to how frequently the momentum parameter is updated and whether it is estimated according to a simple moving average or an exponentially weighted moving average of returns. The reliability of scenario sets generated for multiple instances is assessed by applying a recently developed statistical tool. Backtesting is conducted in case studies of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index for two different historical periods. The numerical results show that the frequency with which the expected return is updated does not significantly influence the performance of the scenario generation procedure, whereas how the expected return is calculated affects the autocorrelation and dispersion of generated scenarios drastically. All scenario generation schemes are highly sensitive to the estimated volatility of the index returns. Among the three processes tested, the algorithms that incorporate momentum estimates according to an exponentially weighted moving average can generate reliable scenarios when the volatility estimation error is small.

Solvent-Responsive Radical Dimers	ORGANIC LETTERS			English	Article							BOND	An air- and thermally stable aryl dicyanomethyl radical is reported that switches between two dimeric forms-a sigma dimer and a pi dimer-by changing the solvent. The two dimer forms exhibit unique optical properties leading to solvatochromic behavior. The solvent-responsive behavior of these radicals can be explained by the higher polarizability of the pimer than the sigma dimer that leads to pimer stabilization in polar solvents.

Multi-trait Genomic Selection Methods for Crop Improvement	GENETICS			English	Article						multi-trait genomic selection; simulation; optimization; Genomic Prediction	INDEX SELECTION; STRATEGY; OPTIMIZATION; RESISTANCE; MODELS	Plant breeders make selection decisions based on multiple traits, such as yield, plant height, flowering time, and disease resistance. A commonly used approach in multi-trait genomic selection is index selection, which assigns weights to different traits relative to their economic importance. However, classical index selection only optimizes genetic gain in the next generation, requires some experimentation to find weights that lead to desired outcomes, and has difficulty optimizing nonlinear breeding objectives. Multi-objective optimization has also been used to identify the Pareto frontier of selection decisions, which represents different trade-offs across multiple traits. We propose a new approach, which maximizes certain traits while keeping others within desirable ranges. Optimal selection decisions are made using a new version of the look-ahead selection (LAS) algorithm, which was recently proposed for single-trait genomic selection, and achieved superior performance with respect to other state-of-the-art selection methods. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method, a case study is developed using a realistic data set where our method is compared with conventional index selection. Results suggest that the multi-trait LAS is more effective at balancing multiple traits compared with index selection.

J	Ward, T				Ward, Thomas			Evaporation driven detachment of a liquid bridge from a syringe needle in repose	PHYSICS OF FLUIDS			English	Article							STABILITY LIMITS; MINIMUM VOLUME; INSTABILITY; PARALLEL; MENISCI	In this paper, a study of the stability of an evaporating semi-unbounded axisymmetric liquid bridge that forms between a syringe needle tip and a horizontal interface by using both theory and experiments is presented. Here, the evaporation produces slow quasistatic motion such that it allows one to use hydrostatics to analyze interface profiles via solutions to the Young-Laplace equation. The two main parameters, in the hydrostatic limit, are the familiar Bond number and a slenderness parameter that often appears in the literature that studies liquid bridge stability. The axisymmetric Young-Laplace equation yields a semi-analytical solution for capillary pressure at zero Bond number using boundary conditions appropriate for this study. At finite Bond numbers, computation of interface profiles is used to estimate the maximum slenderness. Experiments using water for Bond numbers 0.01 < Bo < 0.1 show good agreement for the maximum slenderness when comparing those results with predictions based on solutions to the Young-Laplace equation.

This paper provides a theory for how a dynamically-consistent decision maker can be averse to partial information as a consequence of ambiguity aversion. It introduces a class of recursive preferences on an extended choice domain, which allows the preferences to depend on how information is dynamically revealed and to depart from the standard expected-utility theory. A new notion of ambiguity aversion, called Event Complementarity, exactly characterizes aversion to partial information. Familiar static ambiguity-averse preferences are embedded into the general recursive model, in which conditions for partial information aversion are identified. The findings suggest that Event Complementarity overlaps with yet still differs from the conventional notion of ambiguity aversion.

Recent studies of prison murders make clear that serious, violent, and chronic career criminals are most likely to perpetrate inmate murders with equivocal evidence of the role of prior homicide offending on prison murder. Using retrospective administrative data from 1,005 prisoners selected from the southwestern United States, the current study examined whether homicide offending in the community is itself an importation factor that is useful for understanding prison murder and thus can be used to understand continuity in homicidal offending from the community to confinement context. Rare events logistic regression models found that individuals sentenced for first-degree murder are more likely to perpetrate prison murder. A separate rare events logistic regression model with any type of homicide commitment offense as a predictor provided similar findings suggesting these effects are robust to model specification. Given its gravity and fundamental threat to prison safety and security, we encourage data collection and additional research on prison murder and the inmates that perpetrate it.

Using the property of geometrical congruence in the impressions, the degree of correspondence is quantified using ideas from graph theory and maximum clique (MC). The algorithm uses thexandycoordinates of the edges in the images as the data. We focus on local areas inQand the corresponding regions inKand extract features for comparison. Using pairs of images with known origin, we train a random forest to classify pairs into mates and non-mates. We collected impressions from 60 pairs of shoes of the same brand and model, worn over six months. Using a different set of very similar shoes, we evaluated the performance of the algorithm in terms of the accuracy with which it correctly classified images into source classes.

We document the process we used to guide youth reflection on themselves as learners and, more specifically, detail our discoveries about their schools as learning places. Using critical literacy as a frame, we assert that youth insights about the physical, relational, and agentive environments of school reveal that they were able to read themselves as products of their community "text" in ways supported by scholarly understandings of educational inequity. This advanced and legitimized youth representation in our university-school-community partnership effort.

We show using linear stability analysis that an anodization model including viscous oxide flow accurately predicts the scaling relation governing pore spacing. Flow is driven by nonuniform compressive stress near the oxide-solution interface, resulting from anion adsorption on surface growth sites. The interfacial stress layer is approximated as surface stress, leading to analogous instability mechanisms as in the surface-tension driven Marangoni instability of thin liquid films.

This study aimed to fabricate the support structure by using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), which has advantages over conventional material such as low cost, low printable temperature, and high biodegradability. Once dissolved in water over gelling temperature, the HPMC based hydrogel exhibited shear-thinning behavior with decreasing apparent viscosity values at higher shear rates. The shear-dependent viscosity makes the HPMC hydrogel extrudable throughout the printing process and the printed structure stable enough without deformation. As concentration increased, apparent viscosity, and storage modulus both subsequently increased. These rheological properties indicated that the concentration of HPMC K4M hydrogel significantly influenced the printability and shape retention ability, which is associated with the mechanical strength of printed filaments. The highest concentration, 12% w/v, should have the best ability to hold the printed shape over time due to the highest G' and lowest loss tangent. The printability test also showed that K4M 12% w/v could be printed into different fill density (100, 75, and 50%) with different patterns, i.e., rectilinear and Hilbert curve. The selection of fill density and pattern both have an effect on surface roughness and porosity. The printed support material was compatible with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), which is the material to fabricate the main structure for 3D printing. The support material made of HPMC can be easily removed by peeling off from the main structure without visible residual.

Glycerol and water were added as plasticizers at 11 and 27% starch weight, respectively. The highest tensile strength (TS) and longest elongation to break (EB) for dry films were observed at 70:30 HP: NS ratio, which was 25.76 MPa, and 3.97%, respectively. However, TS and EB of this 70:30 blend extruded starch film exhibited low resistance upon wetting for 10s. The film TS and EB were reduced to 13.26 MPa and 3.35%, respectively. Addition of 0.5% (wt/wt starch) succinic acid (SA) as a cross-linker to 70:30 HP: NS starch blend before film extrusion positively affected both TS and EB of films upon wetting; rather higher TS (16.64 MPa) and EB (4.85%) values were observed, which indicated improvement in water resistance of the films. Sheet-extruded films from 70:30 HP: NS blends resulted in improved dry strength, and upon cross-linking with SA, improved wet strength as well. The films had smooth and compact structure, which was explained by esterification/transesterification reactions promoted by SA, and confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. Practical Applications Manufacturing packaging films from biological sources, as well as coating materials, would be beneficial to the environment along with wider applications. Biobased packaging materials include both edible coatings and edible films along with primary and secondary packaging materials, and could also have non-food applications. They are derived from renewable sources and are potentially biodegradable through composting (which is a technique for waste management). Hydroxypropylation of starch results in wider functionality, and sheet-extrusion can result in more flexible and transparent films. Blends of 70:30 HP: NS resulted in stronger sheet-extruded films; testing of both dry and wet strengths of films indicated its suitability for both as edible coating (wet application), and other dry coatings/ films. These blend film can be an alternative to synthetic packaging films within their limitations.

This requirement also enables mosquitoes to serve as efficient vectors to acquire and potentially transmit a multitude of mosquito-borne diseases, most notably malaria. Recent studies suggest that mos-quito immunity is stimulated following a blood meal, independent of infection sta-tus. Since blood feeding promotes production of the hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), we hypothesized that 20E plays an important role in priming the immune re-sponse for pathogen challenge. Here, we examine the immunological effects of priming Anopheles gambiae with 20E prior to pathogen infection, demonstrating a significant reduction in bacteria and Plasmodium berghei survival in the mosquito host. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis following 20E treatment identifies several known 20E-regulated genes, as well as several immune genes with previ-ously reported function in antipathogen defense. Together, these data demonstrate that 20E influences cellular immune function and antipathogen immunity following mosquito blood feeding, arguing the importance of hormones in the regulation of mosquito innate immune function. IMPORTANCE Blood feeding is required to provide nutrients for mosquito egg production and serves as a mechanism to acquire and transmit pathogens. Shortly after a blood meal is taken, there is a peak in the production of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), a mosquito hormone that initiates physiological changes, including yolk protein production and mating refractoriness. Here, we examine additional roles of 20E in the regulation of mosquito immunity, demonstrating that priming the immune system with 20E increases mosquito resistance to pathogens. We identify differentially expressed genes in response to 20E treatment, including several involved in innate immune function as well as lipid metabolism and transport. Together, these data argue that 20E stimulates mosquito cellular immune function and innate immunity shortly after blood feeding.

J	Li, XC; Zhou, YY; Zhu, ZY; Cao, WT				Li, Xuecao; Zhou, Yuyu; Zhu, Zhengyuan; Cao, Wenting			A national dataset of 30 m annual urban extent dynamics (1985-2015) in the conterminous United States	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA			English	Article; Data Paper							LAND-COVER DATABASE; PEARL RIVER DELTA; TIME-SERIES; VEGETATION PHENOLOGY; ACCURACY ASSESSMENT; THEMATIC ACCURACY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBANIZATION; AREAS; IMPACTS	Dynamics of the urban extent at fine spatial and temporal resolutions over large areas are crucial for developing urban growth models and achieving sustainable development goals. However, there are limited practices of mapping urban dynamics with these two merits combined. In this study, we proposed a new method to map urban dynamics from Landsat time series data using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and developed a national dataset of annual urban extent (1985-2015) at a fine spatial resolution (30 m) in the conterminous United States (US). First, we derived the change information of urbanized years in four periods that were determined from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), using a temporal segmentation approach. Then, we classified urban extents in the beginning (1985) and ending (2015) years at the cluster level through the implementation of a change vector analysis (CVA)-based approach. We also developed a hierarchical strategy to apply the CVA-based approach due to the spatially explicit urban sprawl over large areas. The overall accuracy of mapped urbanized years is around 90 % with the 1-year tolerance strategy. The mapped urbanized areas in the beginning and ending years are reliable, with overall accuracies of 96 % and 88 %, respectively. Our results reveal that the total urban area increased by about 20 % during the period of 1985-2015 in the US, and the annual urban area growth is not linear over the years. Overall, the growth pattern of urban extent in most coastal states is plateaued over the past three decades while the states in the Midwestern US show an accelerated growth pattern. The derived annual urban extents are of great use for relevant urban studies such as urban area projection and urban sprawl modeling over large areas. Moreover, the proposed mapping framework is transferable for developing annual dynamics of urban extent in other regions and even globally.

Participants completed measures assessing agentic trait and communal trait self-knowledge in the laboratory and later wrote descriptions of six significant autobiographical memories. Results of two studies indicated that agentic trait and communal trait self-knowledge were positively associated with thematic content across memories; however, these associations were more pronounced for events in which the themes were consistent with prototypical thematic tendencies. The roles of trait self-knowledge, prototypical norms, and temporal aspects of the self-concept on significant autobiographical memories were discussed.

A series of dynamic modulus and Hamburg wheel tracking (HWT) tests performed for both mixtures. A sensitivity finite element (FE) viscoelastic analysis developed in this study calibrated with performed dynamic modulus and verified by the HWT test results to evaluate the rutting performance of the mixtures. Then FE simulation evaluated by MEPDG equations for same repetition of HWT tests and the results of mechanistic-empirical local calibration parameters for HMA/WMA, and each mixture developed separately. The results show that presented local calibration could be used instead of local calibration parameters, recommended as one in MEPDG, to improve the accuracy of rutting distresses prediction. The addition of RAP to the WMA mixture could increase the performance of that mixtures.

However, traditional DEM uses sphere clusters to approximate realistic particles, which is computationally demanding when simulating many particles. This study explores the use of physics engine, a platform developed for simulating physical processes in video games, to simulate realistic particles. This paper compares realistic particle simulation methodologies using physics engine and discrete element method, including contact models, parameter settings, computational speeds, and simulation results. The results show that the physics engine and DEM achieve similar simulation outputs, while the physics engine runs significantly faster than DEM, because PhysX uses both CPUs (central processing units) and GPUs (graphics processing units) of computers, triangular face tessellations to represent realistic particles, and a simplified contact model to accelerate simulations. This study provides geo-mechanicians and DEM modelers with one more option for them to consider when they simulate realistic particles.

Fourier ptychography is an image acquisition scheme that uses an array of images to produce high-resolution images in microscopy as well as long-distance imaging, to mitigate the effects of diffraction blurring. The number of measurements is typically much larger than the size of the signal (image or video) to be reconstructed, which translates to high storage and computational requirements. The issue of high sample complexity can be alleviated by utilizing structural properties of the image (or video). In this article, we first discuss a range of sub-sampling schemes which can reduce the amount of measurements in Fourier ptychography setups; however, this makes the problem ill-posed. Correspondingly, we impose structural constraints on the signals to be recovered, to regularize the problem. Through our novel framework of recovery algorithms, we show that one can reconstruct high-resolution images (or video) from fewer samples, via simple and natural assumptions on the structure of the images (or video). We demonstrate the validity of our claims through a series of experiments, both on simulated and real data.

TOR senses nutrients, hormones, metabolites, and stress signals to promote cell and organ growth when conditions are favorable. However, TOR is inhibited when conditions are unfavorable, promoting catabolic processes such as autophagy. Autophagy is a macromolecular degradation pathway by which cells degrade and recycle cytoplasmic materials. TOR negatively regulates autophagy through phosphorylation of ATG13, preventing activation of the autophagy-initiating ATG1-ATG13 kinase complex. Here we review TOR complex composition and function in photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organisms. We also review recent developments in the identification of upstream TOR activators and downstream effectors of TOR. Finally, we discuss recent developments in our understanding of the regulation of autophagy by TOR in photosynthetic organisms.

The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code provides a potential opportunity for packers, working with swine production systems and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), to maintain a significant portion of exports during an ASF outbreak through a combination of producer biosecurity and surveillance, packers only accepting pigs from production systems that meet specific requirements, and the USDA developing veterinary certificates for export stating the pork shipment meets the OIE requirements.

Indeed, MCMC is indispensable for performing Bayesian analysis. Two critical questions that MCMC practitioners need to address are where to start and when to stop the simulation. Although a great amount of research has gone into establishing convergence criteria and stopping rules with sound theoretical foundation, in practice, MCMC users often decide convergence by applying empirical diagnostic tools. This review article discusses the most widely used MCMC convergence diagnostic tools. Some recently proposed stopping rules with firm theoretical footing are also presented. The convergence diagnostics and stopping rules are illustrated using three detailed examples.

In recent years, the use of taconite tailings in pavement construction has increased considerably due to their superior mechanical properties. However, an environmental impact assessment of taconite tailings is required before their potential use in construction purposes. Taconite tailings may leach heavy and toxic metals, which could contaminate the soil, surface, and groundwater. Coarse, sand, fine, and composite sized taconite tailings were subjected to pH-dependent leaching tests in the pH range of 2 to 13 to investigate the leaching behavior of aluminum (Al), chromium (Cr), magnesium (Mg), and sulfate (SO4). In addition, toxic characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP), water leach test (WLT), and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) leach tests were performed to evaluate the leaching behavior of taconite tailings in different environmental conditions. The test results showed the highest concentrations of metals were leached from fine sized taconite, whereas the lowest amounts of metal leached from composite taconite tailings. Al and Cr demonstrated amphoteric leaching patterns, whereas Mg showed a cationic leaching pattern. The leached concentrations of SO4 were found to be pH-independent at the pH range of 4 to 13. Except for Al, the leached concentrations of other elements were below the U.S. EPA specified maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water. Taconite tailings leached the highest metal concentrations in TCLP effluent; therefore, it is recommended as the most conservative test procedure to evaluate the leaching of these metals from taconite tailings.

These devices contain many compounds that inherently absorb light energy and do not require an additional matrix to induce desorption and ionization. OLED screens have lateral features with dimensions that are tens of microns in magnitude and depth features that are tens to hundreds of nanometers thick. Monitoring the chemical composition of these features is essential, as contamination and degradation can impact device lifetime. This work demonstrates the capability of LDI-MSI to obtain lateral and partial depth resolved information on multicolored OLED displays and suggests the application to other mixed organic electronics with minimal sample preparation. This was realized when analyzing two different manufactured OLEDs, in an active-matrix display format, without the need to remove the cathode. By utilizing low laser energy and high lateral spatial resolution imaging (10 mu m), depth profiling can be observed while maintaining laterally resolved information, resulting in a three-dimensional MSI approach that would complement existing OLED characterization methods.

Dennis			Jet breakup regimes in liquid-liquid Taylor vortex flow	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW			English	Article						Jet breakup; Taylor vortex; Liquid-Liquid flow; Droplets	SUBMERGED JETS; MASS-TRANSFER; COUETTE FLOW; CROSS-FLOW; EXTRACTION	Optical experiments were used to identify breakup regimes for a liquid jet injected into in a second immiscible liquid undergoing turbulent Taylor vortex flow. Four jetting breakup behaviors were observed and these were compared with analogous jetting regimes in quiescent liquid-liquid systems as well as liquid-gas systems with a gaseous crossflow. Several jet breakage regime maps for liquid-liquid Taylor vortex flow were generated using jet Reynolds number, Ohnesorge number, crossflow Weber number, and momentum flux ratio as organizing parameters. However, selection of the breakup mechanism was found to depend primarily on the jet Reynolds number and was largely independent of parameters characterizing the fluid crossflow, such as the azimuthal Reynolds number and crossflow Weber number. This finding is consistent with previous observations that the downstream droplet size distribution in Taylor vortex flow is relatively insensitive to parameters other than the jet Reynolds number. Lastly, the transitions between the four identified jet breakage regimes were found to be coincident with changes in the mean droplet size observed downstream from the inlet jet.

This field gradient is generated by depletion of ions of the background electrolyte at an ion permselective junction. In this tutorial review, we summarize the fundamental principles and experimental parameters that govern selective ion transport and the stability of the enriched analyte plug. We also examine faradaic ICP (fICP), in which local ion concentration is modulated via electrochemical reactions as an attractive alternative to ICP that achieves similar performance with a decrease in both power consumption and Joule heating. The tutorial covers important challenges to the broad application of ICPF including undesired pH gradients, low volumetric throughput, samples that induce biofouling or are highly conductive, and limited approaches to on-or off-chip analysis. Recent developments in the field that seek to address these challenges are reviewed along with new approaches to maximize enrichment, focus uncharged analytes, and achieve enrichment and separation in water-in-oil droplets. For new practitioners, we discuss practical aspects of ICPF, such as strategies for device design and fabrication and the relative advantages of several types of ion selective junctions and electrodes. Lastly, we summarize tips and tricks for tackling common experimental challenges in ICPF. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Estimating the organic oxygen content of biochar	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BLACK CARBON; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; PYROLYSIS; QUANTIFICATION; TEMPERATURES; ADSORPTION; STABILITY; WOODY; YIELD	The organic O content of biochar is useful for assessing biochar stability and reactivity. However, accurately determining the organic O content of biochar is difficult. Biochar contains both organic and inorganic forms of O, and some of the organic O is converted to inorganic O (e.g., newly formed carbonates) when samples are ashed. Here, we compare estimates of the O content for biochars produced from pure compounds (little or no ash), acid-washed biomass (little ash), and unwashed biomass (range of ash content). Novelty of this study includes a new method to predict organic O content of biochar using three easily measured biochar parameters- pyrolysis temperature, H/C molar ratio, and %biochar yield, and evidence indicating that the conventional difference method may substantially underestimate the organic O in biochar and adversely impact the accuracy of O:C ratios and van Krevelen plots. We also present evidence that acid washing removed 17% of the structural O from biochars and significantly changes O/C ratios. Environmental modelers are encouraged to use biochar H:C ratios.

A candidate short-range wireless network for aircraft onboard communications is outlined using the common ZigBee protocol and privacy-preserving search implemented as a secure publish/subscribe system using specially coded metadata. Formally specifying safety and security properties and modeling the network in New e(X)tensible Model Verifier enable verification and fault analysis via model checking and lay the groundwork for future certification avenues. Experiments formally analyzing the candidate wireless network are reported, showing overhead and availability for encrypted and fault-tolerant communications. A formal model is proposed, which allows system designers to estimate communication failure rates and directly trade off fault tolerance for bandwidth, while preserving communication security.

J	Rodriguez, G				Rodriguez, Gabriel			Suburban schools as sites of inspection: Understanding Latinx youth's sense of belonging in a suburban high school	EQUITY & EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION			English	Article								Through a critical ethnographic approach, this study examines how Latinx youth made sense of race, space, and place at a predominantly white, well-resourced suburban high school outside of Chicago, Illinois. Employing spatial theory and borderland theory, I analyze the experiences of 19 Latinx youth to learn how they understood and navigated the racialized borders of their school and how that, in turn, shaped how they built a sense of belonging for themselves. The findings focus on how whiteness and white youth set the stage for how Latinx youth take up space and build community. Moreover, despite the constraints they endure, Latinx youth enact their agency in ways that can help schools reimagine how to create more inclusive student communities.

Wind tunnel study of wake-induced aerodynamics of parallel stay-cables and power conductor cables in a yawed flow	WIND AND STRUCTURES			English	Article						tandem arrangement; smooth cylinders; grooved cylinders; yawed cable; bundled cables; power conductors	2 CIRCULAR-CYLINDERS; INDUCED VIBRATIONS; TANDEM ARRANGEMENT; BRIDGE CABLES; FORCES; IDENTIFICATION; INTERFERENCE; COEFFICIENTS; NUMBER; DRAG	Wake-induced aerodynamics of yawed circular cylinders with smooth and grooved surfaces in a tandem arrangement was studied. This pair of cylinders represent sections of stay-cables with smooth surfaces and high-voltage power conductors with grooved surfaces that are vulnerable to flow-induced structural failure. The study provides some insight for a better understanding of wake-induced loads and galloping problem of bundled cables. All experiments in this study were conducted using a pair of stationary section models of circular cylinders in a wind tunnel subjected to uniform and smooth flow. The aerodynamic force coefficients and vortex-shedding frequency of the downstream model were extracted from the surface pressure distribution. For measurement, polished aluminum tubes were used as smooth cables; and hollow tubes with a helically grooved surface were used as power conductors. The aerodynamic properties of the downstream model were captured at wind speeds of about 6-23 m/s (Reynolds number of 5x10(4) to 2.67x10(5) for smooth cable and 2x10(4) to 1.01x10(5) for grooved cable) and yaw angles ranging from 0 degrees to 45 degrees while the upstream model was fixed at the various spacing between the two model cylinders. The results showed that the Strouhal number of yawed cable is less than the non-yawed case at a given Reynolds number, and its value is smaller than the Strouhal number of a single cable. Additionally, compared to the single smooth cable, it was observed that there was a reduction of drag coefficient of the downstream model, but no change in a drag coefficient of the downstream grooved case in the range of Reynolds number in this study.

The Impact of Eight Hybrid Tomato Rootstocks on 'BHN 589' Scion Yield, Fruit Quality, and Plant Growth Traits in a Midwest High Tunnel Production System	HORTSCIENCE			English	Article						Solanum lycopersicum; soluble solids content; total titratable acids	ORGANIC HEIRLOOM TOMATOES; GRAFTED TOMATOES; FIELD PRODUCTION; VERTICILLIUM WILT; SOIL QUALITY; TOLERANCE; WATER; TEMPERATURE; VEGETABLES; MANAGEMENT	Prior work in a Midwestern United States high tunnel indicated that hybrid and heirloom tomato scions grafted to hybrid rootstock 'RST-04-106-T' had a minimal yield increase in the absence of soilborne disease pressure, which underscored the need for continued regional trials of alternative, commercially available tomato rootstocks. Objectives of the present study were to assess yield, fruit quality [pH, soluble solids content (SSC), total titratable acids (TTA), and firmness], and plant growth traits (plant height, stem diameter, and biomass) of grafted tomato with eight different hybrid rootstocks. 'BHN 589', a determinate hybrid tomato, was grafted to 'Arnold', 'Beaufort', 'DRO141TX', 'Estamino', 'Maxifort', 'RST-04-106-T', and two trial rootstocks, '946 TRS' and '980 TRS'. Research was conducted April to September in 2017 and 2018 in a 9.1-m wide x 29.2-m long x 3.7-m tall single-poly high tunnel located at the Iowa State University Horticulture Research Station, Ames, IA. There were five plants per treatment in a randomized complete block design with five replications. Weekly harvests took place 13 times each season. 'BHN 589' grafted to 'Arnold', 'Beaufort', 'DRO141TX', 'Estamino', or 'Maxifort' had 30% to 119% more marketable fruit and had a higher marketable fruit weight by 1.3 to 4.1 kg per plant compared with nongrafted plants. Fruit quality differences were minimal in 2017 and null in 2018, as indicated by fruit pH, SSC, TTA, and the SSC: TTA ratio. The same five high-yielding rootstock treatments were the tallest, ranging from 184 to 214 cm in height. In 2017, shoot biomass of 'BHN 589' grafted to 'Arnold', 'Beaufort', 'DRO141TX', 'Estamino', and 'Maxifore was 59 to 100 g more than that of nongrafted plants; in 2018, 'BHN 589' grafted to 'Maxifore and 'DRO141TX' had the largest shoot biomass at 386 and 315 g, respectively. Overall, the results of this study indicate that 'Arnold', 'DRO141TX', and 'Estamino' may be comparable in performance to the widely used rootstocks 'Beaufort' and 'Maxifore when grown under conditions lacking biotic or abiotic stress. Our results provide promising new options for Midwestern U.S. growers of high tunnel tomato who are seeking high-performing rootstocks.

Certain sparse models can be derived through specific variational approximations to the true posterior, and knots can be selected to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximate and true posterior. While this has been a successful approach, simultaneous optimization of knots can be slow due to the number of parameters being optimized. Furthermore, there have been few proposed methods for selecting the number of knots, and no experimental results exist in the literature. We propose using a one-at-a-time knot selection algorithm based on Bayesian optimization to select the number and locations of knots. We showcase the competitive performance of this method relative to optimization of knots simultaneously on three benchmark datasets, but at a fraction of the computational cost.

In this process, computers analyze a few scanned particles to extract morphological characteristics of the target soil, which are used to clone as many particles as necessary. However, many natural granular soils contain a wide range of particle shapes mixing more than one type of morphological characteristics, causing difficulties in cloning. This research aims to address this challenge by integrating spherical harmonics with Gaussian mixture model, expectation-maximization, and Dirichlet process. Spherical harmonics coefficients are used to characterize morphological information of the granular soil. Gaussian mixture model is used to fit a function to the mixed morphological characteristics. The expectation-maximization and Dirichlet process are used to estimate the fitting parameters in Gaussian mixture model. Then, Gaussian mixture model is used to generate new spherical harmonics coefficients and then generate new particles. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methodology are verified using a Griffin sand. Although this approach is developed for granular soils, the proposed technique can also be used to clone other particulate materials.

Failure to Maintain Acetate Homeostasis by Acetate-Activating Enzymes Impacts Plant Development(1)([OPEN])	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							PYRUVATE-DEHYDROGENASE COMPLEX; FATTY-ACID SYNTHESIS; ACETYL-COENZYME-A; MITOCHONDRIAL ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE; ATP-CITRATE LYASE; ETHANOLIC FERMENTATION; METABOLIC FLUX; ARABIDOPSIS; SYNTHETASE; GROWTH	Plastidic and peroxisomal acetate-activating enzymes prevent the hyperaccumulation of acetate that otherwise causes defects in vegetative and reproductive growth. The metabolic intermediate acetyl-CoA links anabolic and catabolic processes and coordinates metabolism with cellular signaling by influencing protein acetylation. In this study we demonstrate that in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), two distinctly localized acetate-activating enzymes, ACETYL-COA SYNTHETASE (ACS) in plastids and ACETATE NON-UTILIZING1 (ACN1) in peroxisomes, function redundantly to prevent the accumulation of excess acetate. In contrast to the near wild-type morphological and metabolic phenotypes of acs or acn1 mutants, the acs acn1 double mutant is delayed in growth and sterile, which is associated with hyperaccumulation of cellular acetate and decreased accumulation of acetyl-CoA-derived intermediates of central metabolism. Using multiple mutant stocks and stable isotope-assisted metabolic analyses, we demonstrate the twin metabolic origins of acetate from the oxidation of ethanol and the nonoxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, with acetaldehyde being the common intermediate precursor of acetate. Conversion from pyruvate to acetate is activated under hypoxic conditions, and ACS recovers carbon that would otherwise be lost from the plant as ethanol. Plastid-localized ACS metabolizes cellular acetate and contributes to the de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids and Leu; peroxisome-localized ACN1 enables the incorporation of acetate into organic acids and amino acids. Thus, the activation of acetate in distinct subcellular compartments provides plants with the metabolic flexibility to maintain physiological levels of acetate and a metabolic mechanism for the recovery of carbon that would otherwise be lost as ethanol, for example following hypoxia.

We used telemetry-implanted male and female adult rats exposed to an organophosphate (OP) neurotoxicant, diisopropylflourophosphate (DFP), to test sex differences in the severity of status epilepticus (SE) and the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). Females had significantly less severe SE and decreased epileptiform spikes compared with males, although females received a higher dose of DFP than males. The estrous stages had no impact on seizure susceptibility, but rats with severe SE had a significantly prolonged diestrus. A previously demonstrated disease-modifying agent, an inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 1400W, was tested in both sexes. None of the eight males treated with 1400W developed convulsive SRS during 4 weeks post-DFP exposure, while two of seven females developed convulsive SRS. Concerning gliosis and neurodegeneration, there were region-specific differences in the interaction between sex and SE severity.

Differential motor learning via reward and punishment	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Reward; punishment; visuomotor adaptation; explicit learning	VISUOMOTOR ADAPTATION; SENSORY PREDICTION; EXPLICIT STRATEGY; ERROR; FEEDBACK; SAVINGS; MEMORY; MODELS	Visuomotor adaptation involves multiple processes such as explicit learning, implicit learning from sensory prediction errors, and model-free mechanisms like use-dependent plasticity. Recent findings show that reward and punishment differently affect visuomotor adaptation. This study examined whether punishment and reward had distinct effects on explicit learning. When participants practised adapting to a large, abrupt visual rotation during reaching for a virtual visual target, visual feedback of the cursor was not provided. Only performance-based scalar reward or punishment feedback (money gained or lost) was used, thereby emphasising explicit processes during adaptation. The results revealed that punishment, compared with reward, induced faster adaptation and greater variability of reaching in the initial phase of adaptation. We interpret these findings as reflecting enhanced explicit learning, likely due to loss aversion.

These cracks provide a direct path for water and deleterious agents to enter the structural system, causing corrosion of the embedded steel bars and tendons. To avoid significant maintenance costs, safety concerns, or both, an innovative longitudinal joint between two adjacent box beams was designed in the current study. This joint is 61/2 in. wide with roughened surfaces, filled with shrinkage compensating concrete and reinforced by steel bars. The joint was evaluated on a small-scale basis and satisfactory performance was obtained in resisting early-age cracks. In the current paper, the joint design is further evaluated through experiments on a 31 ft long specimen during the joint's early age, and when it is subjected to multiple levels of cyclic loads. A finite element (FE) model that is capable of simulating the early-age concrete hardening was also developed and validated against the experimental data. The early-age, time-dependent stress development in the joint and at the interface of the joint and box beam was investigated using the FE model. Based on the results of laboratory tests and FE simulations, the innovative joint was found to remain crack free without the utilization of a shear key or transverse post-tensioning. The "compression-dominate" joint created by the expansive joint material and transverse reinforcing bars across the interface is expected to address the issues associated with early age, while ensuring the long-term durability and performance of box-beam bridges.

By considering truncated learning effect, the actual processing time of a job is a function of its position index in the schedule and a control parameter. In a production scenario with truncated learning effect, the actual processing time of a job will not be lower than a threshold when the number of processed jobs increases. We develop a branch and bound algorithm to minimize the makespan. A lower bound and a dominance property have been proposed to increase the speed of elimination process in the branch and bound algorithm.

When such an intermittent system is powered off, it cannot keep track of time using conventional means. However, a continuous sense of time is critical for any system running real-time or time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we present HARC (Heterogeneous Array of Redundant Persistent Clocks), a novel solution to the problem of timekeeping for batteryless, intermittently-powered systems. HARC uses a heterogeneous, redundant array of capacitor-based persistent clocks that each decay in parallel, but at different rates, to provide variation-resilient high accuracy over a wide range of power off-times. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of HARC using experimental evaluations on a HARC prototype, and trace-based simulations of HARC-supported communication directly between two devices intermittently-powered by RF harvesting.

Midwestern cropping system effects on drainage water quality and crop yields	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							RYE COVER CROP; SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE; MISSISSIPPI RIVER; PHOSPHORUS LOSSES; NITROGEN UPTAKE; TILE DRAINAGE; SWINE MANURE; CORN; TILLAGE; NITRATE	Grain producers are challenged to maximize crop production while utilizing nutrients efficiently and minimizing negative impacts on water quality. There is a particular concern about nutrient export to the Gulf of Mexico via loss from subsurface drainage systems. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of crop rotation, tillage, crop residue removal, swine manure applications, and cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crops on nitrate-N (NO3-N) and total reactive phosphorus (TRP) loss via subsurface drainage. The study was evaluated from 2008 through 2015 using 36 0.4-ha plots outfitted with a subsurface drainage water quality monitoring system. Results showed that when swine manure was applied before both corn (Lea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], drainage water had significantly higher 8-yr-average flow-weighted NO3-N concentrations compared with swine manure applied before corn only in a corn-soybean rotation. The lowest NO3-N loss was 15.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1 )from a no-till corn-soybean treatment with rye cover crop and spring application of urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) to corn. The highest NO3-N loss was 29.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1 ) from swine manure applied to both corn and soybean. A rye cover crop reduced NO3-N loss, whereas tillage and residue management had little impact on NO3-N loss. Losses of TRP averaged <32 g Pha(-1) yr(-1 ) from all treatments. Corn yield was negatively affected by both no-till management and cereal rye cover crops. Results showed that cropping management affected N leaching but impacts on P leaching were minimal.

More importantly, we study the interaction effect between explicit linguistic structures (e.g., linear, constituency, and dependency) and implicit structures elicited by attention mechanisms. Empirical results on multiple datasets demonstrate salient patterns of substitutability between the two families of structures (explicit and implicit). Our findings not only provide intellectual foundations for the popular use of "linear LSTM + attention" architectures in NLP/QA research, but also have implications in other modalities and domains.

The conservation and ubiquity of EI among different types of bacteria makes the enzyme a potential target for antimicrobial research. Here, we use NMR-based fragment screening to identify novel inhibitors of EI. We identify three molecular fragments that allosterically inhibit the phosphoryl transfer reaction catalyzed by EI by interacting with the enzyme at a surface pocket located more than 10 angstrom away from the substrate binding site. Interestingly, although the three molecules share the same binding pocket, we observe that two of the discovered EI ligands act as competitive inhibitors while the third ligand acts as a mixed inhibitor. Characterization of the EI-inhibitor complexes by NMR and Molecular Dynamics simulations reveals key interactions that perturb the fold of the active site and provides structural foundation for the different inhibitory activity of the identified molecular fragments. In particular, we show that contacts between the inhibitor and the side-chain of V292 are crucial to destabilize binding of the substrate to EI. In contrast, mixed inhibition is caused by additional contacts between the inhibitor and alpha-helix 2 that perturb the active site structure and turnover in an allosteric manner. We expect our results to provide the basis for the development of second generation allosteric inhibitors of increased potency and to suggest novel molecular strategies to combat drug-resistant infections.

It is often biased, time-consuming, and laborious. Machine learning methods based on plant leave images have been proposed to improve the disease recognition process. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been adopted and proven to be very effective. Despite the good classification accuracy achieved by CNNs, the issue of limited training data remains. In most cases, the training dataset is often small due to significant effort in data collection and annotation. In this case, CNN methods tend to have the overfitting problem. In this paper, Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) is combined with label smoothing regularization (LSR) to improve the prediction accuracy and address the overfitting problem under limited training data. Experiments show that the proposed WGAN-GP enhanced classification method can improve the overall classification accuracy of plant diseases by 24.4% as compared to 20.2% using classic data augmentation and 22% using synthetic samples without LSR.

Using lean and hyperphagia-induced obese female mice aged 10 weeks, we determined that the ovary from obese female mice had elevated (P < 0.10) levels of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein in oocytes of both small and large follicles. Phosphorylated ATM at serine 1981 was greater (P < 0.05) in large relative to small follicles with no additional impact of obesity. Obesity increased (P < 0.05) gamma H2AX in small follicles in obese relative to lean ovaries, while large follicles of both lean and obese mice had detectable levels of gamma H2AX. Cleaved caspase 3 was reduced (P < 0.05) in the small follicles of obese relative to lean ovaries. In large follicles of lean mice, cleaved caspase 3 was increased in large compared to small follicles (P < 0.05) but this pattern was absent in obese mice. Breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) or the phosphorylated BRCA1 proteins were observably altered by obesity. These data demonstrate that markers of DNA damage and repair have a follicle-dependent stage location and that obesity alters ATM and cleaved caspase 3 in a follicular stage dependent manner.

The development of foods that increase satiety and reduce food may aid weight management. This study determined the effect of consuming soluble fiber dextrin (SFD) on appetite, appetitive hormones, breath hydrogen and food intake in adults. Forty-three participants completed this study. For each treatment, 50% of the SFD was provided in liquid form as part of breakfast and 50% in solid form as a morning snack. Appetite questionnaires, blood and breath samples were collected immediately before breakfast and at regular intervals during the test session. The participants consumed an ad libitum lunch meal, afternoon snack and dinner meal, and the amount eaten was recorded. Following dinner, participants left the laboratory but were required to keep a diet diary for the remainder of the day. Breath hydrogen concentration was significantly higher following the consumption of SFD compared to control (p < 0.05). There was no observed overall treatment effect of consuming SFD on GLP-1 (Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1), ghrelin, CCK-8 (Cholecystokinin) or PYY3-36 (Petptide YY) (p > 0.05). Moreover, consuming foods containing SFD had no effect on subjective appetite or food intake (p > 0.05). Consuming foods containing SFD increased breath hydrogen but did not influence food intake, appetite or appetitive hormones. However, the limitations of this study may have individually or collectively masked an effect of SFD on food intake and appetite.

J	Campbell, C; Olsen, MG; Vigil, RD				Campbell, Charlton; Olsen, Michael G.; Vigil, R. Dennis			Droplet size distributions in liquid-liquid semi-batch Taylor vortex flow	AIP ADVANCES			English	Article							EMULSIONS	Optical methods were used to measure droplet size distributions in a liquid-liquid Taylor vortex reactor oriented vertically along its main axis and operated in a semi-batch fashion with continuous feed of the dispersed phase and no feed or removal of the continuous liquid. The effects of two operational parameters on droplet size distributions were considered, including the inner cylinder angular velocity and the dispersed phase inlet flow rate. Both the mean droplet diameter and the droplet size distribution were found to depend upon the jet Reynolds number and were independent of cylinder rotation speed up to the largest azimuthal Reynolds number investigated (60 000). The droplet size distribution underwent a transition from a unimodal distribution at low cylinder rotation speeds to a bimodal distribution at intermediate speeds. At the largest rotation speeds considered, the bimodal distribution became right-skewed. These observations provide support for the hypothesis that the mean droplet size and size distribution are determined primarily by jet breakage dynamics at the tips of inlet nozzles. Furthermore, the mean droplet size data collected from two geometrically distinct reactors can be collapsed onto a universal curve by plotting the Weber number against the jet Reynolds number.

Optimization of QuEChERS Method for Simultaneous Determination of Neonicotinoid Residues in Pollinator Forage	MOLECULES			English	Article						neonicotinoid; insecticides; plant tissue; pollen; LC-MS; MS; method development; monitoring	ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS; INSECTICIDES; EXPOSURE; POLLEN; METABOLITES; HONEY	Consistent with the large-scale use of pesticide seed treatments in U.S. field crop production, there has been an increased use of neonicotinoid-treated corn and soybean seed over the past decade. Neonicotinoids can move downwind to adjacent off-field pollinator habitats in dust from planting and/or move downslope to habitats in surface water. The extent of potential neonicotinoid exposure to pollinators from neonicotinoid movement into these adjacent pollinator habitats is unclear. Pollen and leaf tissue extractions were completed using a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction procedure. Samples were subjected to a clean-up step using dispersive solid-phase extraction (dSPE) techniques prior to analysis. The compounds in the extracts were separated on a reversed-phase column with gradient elution and confirmed with tandem mass spectrometry. The extraction method showed acceptable recoveries of analytes ranging from 78.4 to 93.6% and 89.4 to 101% for leaf tissue and pollen, respectively. The method's detection limits ranged from 0.04 to 0.3 ng/g in milkweed leaf tissue and 0.04 to 1.0 ng/g in pollen. The method is currently being employed in ongoing studies surveying pollen from a diversity of forbs and milkweed leaves obtained from habitat patches established within fields with a history of using neonicotinoid-treated seeds.

J	Song, G				Song, Guang			Shape-preserving elastic solid models of macromolecules	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; SINGLE-PARAMETER; PROTEIN; DYNAMICS; MOTIONS; FLUCTUATIONS; CONSTRUCTION; COMPUTATION; MICROSCOPY; CAPSIDS	Author summary Mass-spring models have been a standard approach in classical molecular modeling where atoms are modeled as spheres with a mass and their interactions modeled as springs. The models have been extremely successful. Thinking ahead, however, as molecular systems of our interest grow more quickly in size or dimension than what our computation resources can keep up with, some adjustments in methodology are timely. This work presents a vastly different elastic solid model (ESM) of macromolecules that shares the same simplicity and efficiency as mass-spring models in producing the equilibrium dynamics and moreover, offers some unique features that make it suitable for much larger systems. ESM is different from ENMs in that it treats macromolecules as elastic solids. Our particular version of ESM model presented in this work, named alpha ESM, captures the shape of a given biomolecule most economically using alpha shape, a well-established technique from the computational geometry community. Consequently, it can produce most economical coarse-grained models while faithfully preserving the shape. ESM can be applied also to structures without atomic coordinates such as those from cryo-electron microscopy. Mass-spring models have been a standard approach in molecular modeling for the last few decades, such as elastic network models (ENMs) that are widely used for normal mode analysis. In this work, we present a vastly different elastic solid model (ESM) of macromolecules that shares the same simplicity and efficiency as ENMs in producing the equilibrium dynamics and moreover, offers some significant new features that may greatly benefit the research community. ESM is different from ENM in that it treats macromolecules as elastic solids. Our particular version of ESM presented in this work, named alpha ESM, captures the shape of a given biomolecule most economically using alpha shape, a well-established technique from the computational geometry community. Consequently, it can produce most economical coarse-grained models while faithfully preserving the shape and thus makes normal mode computations and visualization of extremely large complexes more manageable. Secondly, as a solid model, ESM's close link to finite element analysis renders it ideally suited for studying mechanical responses of macromolecules under external force. Lastly, we show that ESM can be applied also to structures without atomic coordinates such as those from cryo-electron microscopy. The complete MATLAB code of alpha ESM is provided.

J	Min, K; Chen, K; Arora, R				Min, Kyungwon; Chen, Keting; Arora, Rajeev			Short versus prolonged freezing differentially impacts freeze - thaw injury in spinach leaves: mechanistic insights through metabolite profiling	PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM			English	Article							GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; DEGRADATION IN-VIVO; WOODY PLANT-CELLS; SALICYLIC-ACID; POSTTHAW RECOVERY; SECONDARY METABOLITES; SHORT-TERM; TOLERANCE; STRESS; BIOSYNTHESIS	Plant tissues subjected to short or prolonged freezing to a fixed sub-freezing temperature are expected to undergo similar freeze-desiccation but the former causes substantially less injury than the latter. To gain metabolic insight into this differential response, metabolome changes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves were determined following short-term (0.5 and 3.0 h) vs. prolonged freezing (5.5 and 10.5 h) at -4.5 degrees C resulting in reversible or irreversible injury, respectively. LD50, the freezing duration causing 50% injury, was estimated to be similar to 3.1 h and defined as the threshold beyond which tissues were irreversibly injured. From 39 identified metabolites, 19 were selected and clustered into 3 groups: (1) signaling-related (salicylic acid, aliphatic and aromatic amino acids), (2) injury-related (GABA, lactic acid, maltose, fatty acids, policosanols, TCA intermediates) and (3) recovery-related (ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol). Initial accumulation of salicylic acid during short-term freezing followed by a decline may be involved in triggering tolerance mechanisms in moderately injured tissues, while its resurgence during prolonged freezing may signal programmed cell death. GABA accumulated with increasing freezing duration, possibly to serve as a 'pH-stat' against cytoplasmic acidification resulting from lactic acid accumulation. Mitochondria seem to be more sensitive to prolonged freezing than chloroplasts since TCA intermediates decreased after LD50 while salicylic acid and maltose, produced in chloroplasts, accumulate even at 10.5-h freezing. Fatty acids and policosanols accumulation with increasing freezing duration indicates greater injury to membrane lipids and epicuticular waxes. Ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol accumulated after short-term freezing, supposedly facilitating recovery while their levels decreased in irreversibly injured tissues.

Pretreatments for the continuous production of pyrolytic sugar from lignocellulosic biomass	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Biomass; Pretreatment; Pyrolysis; Sugars; Char agglomeration	BIO-OIL; LEVOGLUCOSAN; LIGNIN; DECOMPOSITION; TEMPERATURE; HYDROLYSIS; YIELDS; WOOD; RICH	Fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass yields little sugar or anhydrosugars compared to pyrolysis of pure polysaccharides because naturally abundant alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEM) in biomass catalyze the fragmentation of pyranose and furanose rings. Sugar yields can be increased dramatically by pretreating the biomass with sulfuric acid prior to pyrolysis, which passivates the catalytic activity of the metals by converting them into thermally stable salts. However, depolymerization of lignin in biomass also depends on the catalytic activity of AAEM. Thus, passivating AAEM has the unintended consequence of slowing the rate of depolymerization and volatilization of lignin, resulting in a transient melt phase that agglomerates and can foul pyrolysis reactors. To overcome this problem, various non-alkali metal sulfates were tested as replacements for sulfuric acid. Iron in the form of ferrous sulfate proved the most effective in depolymerizing lignin without fragmenting pyranose rings. Conventional nitrogen-blown pyrolysis of ferrous sulfate pretreated corn stover achieved WHSV of 4 h(-1) compared to only 0.6 h(-1) for acid pretreated corn stover. Autothermal (air-blown) pyrolysis of ferrous sulfate pretreated corn stover showed even more dramatic improvement, increasing WHSV from 1 h(-1) to 10 h(-1) compared to acid pretreated corn stover under autothermal operation. Fermentable sugar yields from the pyrolysis of corn stover increased from 0.9 wt% to 11.8 wt% on a biomass basis, a 13-fold increase as a result of the ferrous sulfate pretreatment. These advantages combine to increase volumetric sugar productivity from 62 g L-1 h(-1) for conventional pyrolysis of untreated corn stover to 2041 g L-1 h(-1) for autothermal pyrolysis of ferrous sulfate treated corn stover.

Cells are encapsulated using the biopolymer alginate, which is combined with graphene to create a cell-containing hydrogel with increased electrical conductivity. Resulting novel alginate-graphene microfibers showed a 2.5-fold increase over pure alginate microfibers, but did not show significant differences in size and porosity. Cells encapsulated within the microfibers survive for up to 8 days, and maintain similar to 20% live cells over that duration. The biocompatible aqueous graphene suspension used in this investigation was obtained via liquid phase exfoliation of pristine graphite, to create a graphene-alginate pre-hydrogel solution.

Spin Delocalization, Polarization, and London Dispersion Forces Govern the Formation of Diradical Pimers	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							PI-DIMERIZATION; DENSITY FUNCTIONALS; RADICALS; BISTABILITY; CATION; DIMER	Some free radicals are stable enough to be isolated, but most are either unstable transient species or exist as metastable species in equilibrium with a dimeric form, usually a spin-paired sigma dimer or a pi dimer (pimer). To gain insight into the different modes of dimerization, we synthesized and evaluated a library of 15 aryl dicyanomethyl radicals in order to probe what structural and molecular parameters lead to sigma- versus pi-dimerization. We evaluated the divergent dimerization behavior by measuring the strength of each radical association by variable-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, determining the mode of dimerization (sigma- or pi-dimer) by UV-vis spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, and performing computational analysis. We evaluated three different hypotheses to explain the difference in the dimerization behavior: (1) that the dimerization behavior is dictated by radical spin densities; (2) that it is dictated by radical polarizability; (3) that it is dictated by London dispersion stabilization of the pimer. However, no single parameter model in itself was predictive. Two-parameter models incorporating either the computed degree of spin delocalization or the radical polarizability as well as computed estimates for the attractive London dispersion forces in the p-dimers lead to improved forecasts of sigma- vs pi-dimerization mode, and suggest that a balance of spin delocalization of the isolated radical as well as attractive forces between the stacked radicals, govern the formation of diradical pimers.

This study profiles non-micro small non-coding RNA expression changes induced by latent EBV infection. Using small RNA-Seq, 346 non-micro small RNAs were identified as being significantly differentially expressed between EBV(+) BJAB-B1 and EBV(-) BJAB cell lines. Select small RNA expression changes were experimentally validated in the BJAB-B1 cell line as well as the EBV-infected Raji and Jijoye cell lines.

Rheological properties and effects of aging on acrylated epoxidised soybean oil monomer-modified asphalt binder	ROAD MATERIALS AND PAVEMENT DESIGN			English	Article						acrylated epoxidised soybean oil (aeso); modified asphalt; rheology; van Gurp-Palmen curves; master curves; aging susceptibility	GURP-PALMEN-PLOT; POLYMER MODIFICATION; MIX ASPHALT; PERFORMANCE; CLASSIFICATION; MIXTURES; BEHAVIOR; MODULUS; SBS	This investigation examines the rheological properties and effects of aging on laboratory produced acrylated epoxidised soybean oil (AESO) monomer (LabAESO) and commercially available AESO (ComAESO)-modified asphalt binders at various concentration levels. The rheological curves show that the polymerisation of AESO occurs during blending with the polymer and that the entanglement characteristic curvature appears gradually as AESO concentration level increases. The findings indicated that sufficiently high level of LabAESO is necessary to affect the neat asphalt binder's rheological properties as shown in Van Gurp-Palmen curves, master curves, and Black diagrams. The research results revealed that AESO monomer has shown great potential to be used as a modifier in asphalt performance modification. Additionally, LabAESO works better on reducing aging susceptibility than ComAESO, and that is shown clearly with increasing dosage levels of LabAESO and ComAESO.

J	Weems, CF				Weems, Carl F.			Commentary on the Special Issue on Network Analysis: Assessment, Intervention, Theory, and the Nature of Reality: Actualizing the Potential of Network Perspectives on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder	JOURNAL OF TRAUMATIC STRESS			English	Editorial Material							PSYCHOPATHOLOGY SYMPTOM NETWORKS; HYPERAROUSAL; ANHEDONIA; FORBES; MARKON; WRIGHT; YOUTH	This commentary on the Journal of Traumatic Stress special issue on network analysis explores the network perspective on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), emphasizing the advances in research made in this collection of articles. The commentary is organized around the following themes related to actualizing the perspective's methodological, assessment, and intervention potential and the potential shift in the theoretical underpinnings of mental disorders that networks models imply. First, extant data using network analysis suggest that reactions to traumatic stress are more complicated than once thought but that this complexity does not mean efficient, relatively simple heuristics to aid assessment and intervention do not exist. Attention to methodological issues in symptom assessment may help move this aspect of the research forward. Second, the extant research is largely correlational and has not yet established causal linkages, although temporal associations underlying network models are being identified. Prospective and intervention studies employing network analysis are critical. Third, the network perspective of PTSD symptoms may advance research on the mechanisms of risk and resilience (e.g., neurodevelopmental, cognitive behavioral, emotional, and social models) by helping link symptoms to theoretical causal processes. A developmental framework that views the effect of traumatic stress in terms of temporal cascades of reactions with both negative and potentially positive cognitive, behavioral, social, and emotional outcomes fits the network analysis model. Fourth, network models call into question some of the fundamental assumptions underlying the conceptualization of mental disorders, leaving several ontological questions and implications currently unanswered; research examining the implications of the new assumptions is needed.

J	Zhao, YC; Sarkar, A; Wang, XF				Zhao, Yuanchang; Sarkar, Anwesha; Wang, Xuefeng			Peptide nucleic acid based tension sensor for cellular force imaging with strong DNase resistance	BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS			English	Article						Peptide nucleic acid; DNA biosensor; DNase resistance; Integrin; Tension sensor; Cellular force imaging	INTEGRIN; DEOXYRIBONUCLEASE; PURIFICATION; SURVIVAL; ADHESION; URINE; RNA	DNA is a versatile biomaterial with well-defined mechanical and biochemical properties. It has been broadly adopted to synthesize tension sensors that calibrate and visualize cellular forces at the cell-matrix interface. Here we showed that DNA-based tension sensors are vulnerable to deoxyribonucleases (DNases) which cells may express on cell membrane or secret to the culture environment. These DNases can damage the sensors, lower signal-to-noise ratio or even produce false signal in cellular force imaging. To address this issue, we tested peptide nucleic acid (PNA), chemically modified RNA and their hybrids with DNA as alternative biomaterials for constructing tension sensors. Four duplexes: double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), PNA/DNA, dsRNA (modified RNA) and PNA/RNA, were tested and evaluated in terms of DNase resistance, cellular force imaging ability and material robustness. The results showed that all PNA/DNA, dsRNA and PNA/RNA exhibited strong resistance to both soluble DNase I and membrane-bound DNase on cells. However, PNA/RNA-based tension sensor had low signal-to-noise ratio in cellular force imaging, and dsRNA-based tension sensor exhibited strong non-specific signal unrelated to cellular forces. Only PNA/DNA-based tension sensor reported cellular forces with highest signal-to-noise ratio and specificity. Collectively, we confirmed that PNA/DNA hybrid is an accessible material for the synthesis of DNase-resistant tension sensor that retains the force-reporting capability and remains stable in DNase-expressing cells. This new class of tension sensors will broaden the application of tension sensors in the study of cell mechanobiology.

J	Leslie, T				Leslie, Thomas			Fluorescent Lamps: Visual and Thermal Comfort in Modern Interiors	CONSTRUCTION HISTORY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CONSTRUCTION HISTORY SOCIETY			English	Article						Lighting; Office Planning; Interior Design; Fluorescent; Air Conditioning		Air conditioning's impact on the modern office interior was immediate and profound but lost in historical concentrations on thermal comfort has been the importance of fluorescent lighting. Fluorescent lamps and fixtures were key components of what Reyner Banham called "power-membrane ceilings," key counterparts to the glass curtain walls of the 1950s and 1960s. Fluorescent lamps relied on 19th century advances, but they were spurred on by the expiration of incandescent patents in the 1930s. Keen to find new markets to corner, General Electric and Westinghouse developed commercially viable lamps that offered greater electrical and thermal efficiency. Avoiding the heat gain of incandescent lamps, however, was only part of fluorescent lamps' impact on thermal comfort. Their cool operating temperatures allowed the use of easily-formed plastics to house them, leading to reflectors and diffusers that distributed or focused their light with precision. Fluorescent lighting's success can be measured by the evolving standards for light levels which leapt from 3-4 foot-candles (32-40 lux) for clerical work in 1918 to 100 foot-candles (1,000 lux) in 1960. This matched air conditioning's influence on comfort standards as well as its ability to homogenise office floor plates, tuning light levels to tasks below and adding regimented, gridded order to open plan office floors.

Using nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), this study documented prevalence and co-occurrence rates of publicly monitored risks, uncovering higher rates of relevant risks than prior research for poverty, low maternal education, maternal depression, and birth to a single parent. Findings demonstrated significant relationships between multiple risks (i.e., poverty, preterm/low birthweight, low maternal education, single mother, inadequate prenatal care, teen mother, and maternal depression) with academic outcomes. Findings also demonstrated the incremental disadvantages of cumulative risk exposure to academic outcomes, adding to our understanding of cumulative risk with this specific combination of relevant experiences. Findings provide actionable intelligence for public service systems charged with improving child outcomes that goes beyond intractable characteristics of poverty or race, and have implications for cross-sector partnerships among departments of education, public health, and child welfare to address early achievement gaps.

However, the mechanism by which the HIV-1 capsid imports nucleotides is presently unclear. In this work, we carry out a series of Brownian diffusion simulations to elucidate the nucleotide import process through the hexamer pores of the HIV-1 capsid. Our simulations reveal a significant role of the electrostatic field in the import process and the mechanism by which deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) diffuse through the arginine ring: specifically, how IP6s and ATPs, though competing with dNTPs for binding at the pore of the arginine ring, end up accelerating the dNTP import rate by thousands of folds so that it is sufficiently high to fuel the encapsidated DNA synthesis.

Their catalytic activity and selectivity were tunable through rational post-modification of the active site.

At the time of necropsy, numerous nematodes were observed in the crop and proventriculus with evidence of proventriculitis. Nematodes were identified as Contracaecum spp. based on morphological features of the adult worms and eggs. Species level identification of C. fagerholmi were made using nucleotide sequence analysis of the partial cox2 gene. Contracaecum infections are highly prevalent in piscivorous birds that acquire the infection by ingesting fish infected with larval stages of the parasite. Considering the possible zoonotic nature of Contracaecum, humans whose diets include uncooked fresh-water and/or marine fish should handle fresh fish with care, as these may harbor immature stages of Contracaecum spp.	[Chelladurai, Jeba R.

Having an accurate and robust in situ monitoring can assist corrective actions for a closed-loop control of a manufacturing process. The fringe projection technique, as a variation of the structured light technique, has demonstrated significant potential for real-time in situ monitoring and inspection given its merits of conducting simultaneous high-speed and high-accuracy measurements. However, high-speed three-dimensional (3D) scanning methods like fringe projection technique are typically based on triangulation principle, meaning that the depth information is retrieved by analyzing the triangulation relationship between the light emitter (i.e., projector), the image receiver (i.e., camera) and the tested sample surface. Such measurement scheme cannot reconstruct 3D surfaces where large geometrical variations are present, such as a deep hole or a stair geometry. This is because large geometrical variations will block the auxiliary light used in the triangulation-based methods, which will resultantly cause a shadowed area to occur. In this paper, we propose a uniaxial fringe projection technique to address such limitation. We measured a stair model using both conventional triangulation-based fringe projection technique and the proposed method for comparison. Our experiment demonstrates that the proposed uniaxial fringe projection technique can perform high-speed 3D scanning without shadows appearing in the scene. Quantitative testing shows that an accuracy of 1.15% can be obtained using the proposed uniaxial fringe projection system.

The PI-containers are a core component of the PI; however, previous PI studies have not addressed those containers' repositioning, despite its importance and effect on the PI network efficiency. In this paper, we analyze how the PI-containers' design and characteristics will determine the containers' flows in a domestic network context. The flows are studied strategically using a linear programming model minimizing flow imbalances between hubs and simulating the effect of PI-container compatibility. The model is tested using inter-regional freight data from Sweden, and the results are framed using modularity theory. Our analysis reveals that PI-container compatibility in terms of forward and reverse flows determines whether PI presents increased or decreased empty runs compared with the existing conventional logistics system. Departing from modularization theory, we discuss our results, emphasizing not only the importance of keeping synergistic specificity low but also how the characteristics will affect the urgency of technology use. Our implications are important to supply chain managers and policymakers for the future research on the Physical Internet, PI-container repositioning and routing, and packaging design.

Mapping the RNA structural landscape of viral genomes	METHODS			English	Article						RNA; Bioinformatics; Motif discovery; Viral genome; HIV; Zika	SECONDARY STRUCTURE; NONCODING RNAS; RFAM; VISUALIZATION; TRANSCRIPTION; SEQUENCE; IDENTIFICATION; DINUCLEOTIDE; ARCHITECTURE; INITIATION	Functional RNA structures are prevalent in viral genomes, and have been shown to play roles in almost every aspect of their biology. However, the majority of viral RNA remains structurally uncharacterized. This is likely to remain true as the cost of sequencing decreases much faster than the cost of structural characterizations. Because of this, there is a need for rapid, inexpensive methods to highlight regions of viral RNA which are ideal candidates for structure-function analyses. The ScanFold method was developed as a single sequence alternative to traditional RNA structural motif discovery pipelines, which rely heavily on well curated sequence alignments to identify conserved RNA structures. ScanFold focuses on identifying (based on their more stable than expected folding energies) the most likely functional structures encoded within a single large RNA sequence, while allowing predicted motifs to be tested for evidence of structural conservation later. Decoupling these processes can be a benefit to researchers studying viruses lacking the ideal phylogenetic depth to yield evidence of structural conservation. Here, we demonstrate how the most significant ScanFold predicted structures correspond to higher base pairing probabilities, SHAPE reactivities, and predict known functional structures within the ZIKV and HIV-1 genomes with accuracy. Best practices and examples are also shown to aid users in utilizing ScanFold for their own systems of interest. ScanFold is available as a Webserver (https://mosslabtools.bb. iastate.edu/scanfold) or can be downloaded (https://github.com/moss-lab/ScanFold) and run locally.

Traditional manual inspection of fields is often time-consuming and laborious. Automated imaging techniques have recently been successfully applied to detect plant diseases. However, these methods mostly focus on the current state of the crop. This paper proposes a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based model to predict soybean sudden death syndrome (SDS) disease development. To detect SDS at a quadrat level, the proposed method uses satellite images collected from PlanetScope as the training set. The pixel image data include the spectral bands of red, green, blue and near-infrared (NIR). Data collected during the 2016 and 2017 soybean-growing seasons were analyzed. Instead of using individual static imagery, the GRU-based model converts the original imagery into time-series data. SDS predictions were made on different data scenarios and the results were compared with fully connected deep neural network (FCDNN) and XGBoost methods. The overall test accuracy of classifying healthy and diseased quadrates in all methods was above 76%. The test accuracy of the FCDNN and XGBoost were 76.3-85.5% and 80.6-89.2%, respectively, while the test accuracy of the GRU-based model was 82.5-90.4%. The calculation results show that the proposed method can improve the detection accuracy by up to 7% with time-series imagery. Thus, the proposed method has the potential to predict SDS at a future time.

Developing a decision-making framework for insect pest management: a case study usingAphis glycines(Hemiptera:Aphididae)	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						economic analysis; integrated pest management; soybean aphid; resistance management; modeling	SOYBEAN APHID HEMIPTERA; GEOGRAPHIC-DISTRIBUTION; SINGLE-GENE; RESISTANCE; RAG1; ECONOMICS	BACKGROUND The profitability of farming varies based on factors such as a crop's market value, input costs and occurrence of resistant pests, all capable of altering the value of pest management tactics in an integrated pest management program. We provide a framework for calculating expected yield and expected net revenue of pest management scenarios, using the soybean aphid (Aphis glycines) as a case study. Foliar insecticide and host-plant resistance are effective management tactics for preventing yield loss from soybean aphid outbreaks; however, pyrethroid-resistant aphid populations pose a management challenge for farmers. We evaluated eight scenarios relevant to soybean aphid management in Iowa with varying probabilities of aphid outbreaks and insecticide-resistant aphids occurring. RESULTS Our equation suggests that insecticide use is profitable when the probability of an aphid outbreak is >= 29%, and soybean production will become more costly with increasing probability of pyrethroid-resistant aphids. If farmers continue to use pyrethroids, they will not experience financial consequences from pyrethroid-resistant aphids until the chance of insecticide resistance is 48%. Aphid-resistant varieties provided consistent yield and offered the highest net revenue under all conditions. CONCLUSION This framework can be used for other crop-pest systems to evaluate the profitability of management tactics and investigate how resistance impacts revenue for farmers. Including the cost of resistance in crop budgets can help farmers and agronomic consultants comprehend these impacts and enhance decision-making to increase revenue and curb resistance development.

Although researchers have optimized the use of organic and metal matrices for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) of latent fingerprints, the use of development powders as matrices has not been fully investigated. Carbon forensic powder (CFP), a common nonporous development technique, was shown to be an efficient one-step matrix; however, a high-resolution mass spectrometer was required in the low mass range due to carbon clusters. Titanium oxide (TiO2) is another commonly used development powder, especially for dark nonporous surfaces. Here, forensic TiO(2)powder is utilized as a single-step development and matrix technique for chemical imaging of latent fingerprints without the requirement of a high-resolution mass spectrometer. All studied compounds were successfully detected when TiO(2)was used as the matrix in positive mode, although, generally, the overall ion signals were lower than the previously studied CFP. TiO(2)provided quality mass spectrometry (MS) images of endogenous and exogenous latent fingerprint compounds. The subsequent addition of traditional matrices on top of the TiO(2)powder was ineffective for universal detection of latent fingerprint compounds. Forensic TiO(2)development powder works as an efficient single-step development and matrix technique for MALDI-MSI analysis of latent fingerprints in positive mode and does not require a high-resolution mass spectrometer for analysis.

Increased field usage on fields with traffic-sensitive cultivars results in reduced turf cover and therefore decreased field safety. Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L., KBG) is the most widely used cool-season turfgrass on athletic fields due to its dense turf canopy. While most KBG cultivars have strong recuperative potential, significant cultivar differences in ability to withstand athletic field traffic exist. This study was conducted to determine whether leaf epidermal cell sizes predict differences in KBG cultivar traffic tolerance. Upper epidermal cell size, lower epidermal cell size, and intercellular void space (IVS) were measured on three traffic-tolerant and three traffic-sensitive KBG cultivars from the 2011 National Turfgrass Evaluation Program KBG trial, arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Transverse sections of leaf tissue were fixed in an acid/alcohol solution and embedded with paraffin prior to sectioning for imaging by light microscopy. Cell size was determined by counting cells per unit area from light microscopy images. Leaf upper and lower epidermal cell size was not a predictor of traffic tolerance. Differences were measured in IVS at the cultivar level and at the traffic-sensitive vs. traffic-tolerant grouping contrast level. Traffic-tolerant cultivars exhibited larger IVS (2823 mu m(2)) than traffic-sensitive cultivars (1112 mu m(2)). Further investigation of these leaf anatomy size theories in relation to athletic traffic tolerance should be conducted on more cultivars, including recently released commercially available genotypes.

Representing a 'gateway to the West, this inspired the theme of the Highlights in Medical Entomology to reflect on the accomplishments of the past year as we move into a 'new frontier' of vector biology research. Papers were selected broadly across arthropods that influence public health, focusing on topics ranging from West Nile virus transmission, ticks and tick-borne disease, to advances in genetics and 'big data' studies. This included current perspectives on West Nile virus ecology and epidemiology, which has now been endemic in the United States for 20 yr. Additional topics such as the advantages of citizen science and the importance of scientific communication were also discussed.Together, these papers demonstrate the achievements of the vector community while emphasizing the challenges that we collectively face to reduce the burden of vector-borne disease.

Data from 52 independent samples from real classes (N = 7864) suggests a moderate association ofd = .42 between the use of quizzes and academic performance. Effects are even stronger in psychology classes (d = .47) and when quiz performance contributed to class grades (d = .51). We also find that performance on quizzes is strongly correlated with academic performance (k = 19,N = 3814,r = .57) such that quiz performance is relatively strongly predictive of later exam performance. We also found that the use of quizzes is associated with a large increase in the odds of passing a class (k = 5,N = 1004, odds ratio = 2.566).

Construction of synthetic receptors for peptides by the same principle, however, is challenging because of the complexity of the guest molecules and subtle structural differences among closely related sequences. Molecular imprinting of peptides in surface-core doubly-cross-linked micelles yielded hydrophobic pockets complementary to the hydrophobic side chains of peptides. Amide-functionalized bis( acrylamide) cross-linkers such as N, N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) (MBAm) used in the core cross-linking installed a layer of hydrogen bonds at the surfactant/water interface and was found to enhance the molecular recognition of peptides in water, particularly hydrophilic ones rich in polar residues. An extremely strong imprinting effect was obtained, with the imprinted/nonimprinted ratio ranging from 3000 to 10000 for model tripeptides. These hydrogen bonds allowed distinction of closely related peptide sequences and enabled a general, simple, one-pot preparation of highly selective receptors for binding complex hydrophilic peptides with <200 nM affinity in aqueous buffer.

Affine Mendelsohn triple systems and the Eisenstein integers	JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL DESIGNS			English	Article						congruence subgroup; Eisenstein integers; Mendelsohn triple system; orthogonal Latin square; quasigroup		We define a Mendelsohn triple system (MTS) of order coprime with 3, and having multiplication affine over an abelian group, to beaffine, nonramified. By exhibiting a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of affine MTS and those of modules over the Eisenstein integers, we solve the isomorphism problem for affine, nonramified MTS and enumerate these isomorphism classes (extending the work of Donovan, Griggs, McCourt, Oprsal, and Stanovsky). As a consequence, all entropic MTSs of order coprime with 3 and distributive MTS of order coprime with 3 are classified. Partial results on the isomorphism problem for affine MTS with order divisible by 3 are given, and a complete classification is conjectured. We also prove that for any affine MTS, the qualities of being nonramified, pure, and self-orthogonal are equivalent.

Community Susceptibility and Resiliency to COVID-19 Across the Rural-Urban Continuum in the United States	JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH			English	Article						COVID-19; community resiliency; county; rural-urban; susceptibility	HEALTH; PLACE	Purpose This study creates a COVID-19 susceptibility scale at the county level, describes its components, and then assesses the health and socioeconomic resiliency of susceptible places across the rural-urban continuum. Methods Factor analysis grouped 11 indicators into 7 distinct susceptibility factors for 3,079 counties in the conterminous United States. Unconditional mean differences are assessed using a multivariate general linear model. Data from 2018 are primarily taken from the US Census Bureau and CDC. Results About 33% of rural counties are highly susceptible to COVID-19, driven by older and health-compromised populations, and care facilities for the elderly. Major vulnerabilities in rural counties include fewer physicians, lack of mental health services, higher disability, and more uninsured. Poor Internet access limits telemedicine. Lack of social capital and social services may hinder local pandemic recovery. Meat processing facilities drive risk in micropolitan counties. Although metropolitan counties are less susceptible due to healthier and younger populations, about 6% are at risk due to community spread from dense populations. Metropolitan vulnerabilities include minorities at higher health and diabetes risk, language barriers, being a transportation hub that helps spread infection, and acute housing distress. Conclusions There is an immediate need to know specific types of susceptibilities and vulnerabilities ahead of time to allow local and state health officials to plan and allocate resources accordingly. In rural areas it is essential to shelter-in-place vulnerable populations, whereas in large metropolitan areas general closure orders are needed to stop community spread. Pandemic response plans should address vulnerabilities.

In this manuscript, I report the results of comparative case studies of five different introductory physics instructors at three institutions who used data dashboards as part of an active learning approach called 'Peer Instruction'. Instructors expressed frustration with the ways that data displays undermined their existing pedagogical strategies. They were stymied by a lack of clarity on how data is assembled and imbued with meaning, which limited their own sensemaking about the data. They also expressed concerns about how the dashboards facilitated data collection about their instructional planning and decision-making.

Ragweed and sagebrush pollen can distinguish between vegetation types at broad spatial scales	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						Ambrosia; Artemisia; ecoregions; paleoecology; pollen ratio; prairie	NORTHERN GREAT-PLAINS; HOLOCENE CLIMATE; LAKE; NEOTOMA; RECORD; GRASSLANDS; AMERICAN; PATTERNS; SHIFTS; PROXY	Patterns of vegetation distribution at regional to subcontinental scales can inform understanding of climate. Delineating ecoregion boundaries over geologic time is complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing between prairie types at broad spatial scales using the pollen record. Pollen ratios are sometimes employed to distinguish between vegetation types, although their applicability is often limited to a geographic range. The Neotoma Paleoecology Database offers an unparalleled opportunity to synthesize a large number of pollen datasets. Ambrosia (ragweed) is a genus of mesic-adapted species sensitive to summer moisture. Artemisia (sagebrush, wormwood, mugwort) is a genus of dry-mesic-adapted species resilient to drought. The log pollen ratio between these two common taxa was calculated across the North American midcontinent from surface pollen samples housed in the Neotoma Paleoecology Database. The relative proportion of Ambrosia has roughly doubled since European settlement, likely due to widespread disturbance, while Artemisia proportions are nearly unchanged. Correcting surface samples for the disturbance signal in modern Ambrosia proportions will allow Ambrosia, a strong indicator of summer moisture, to be more accurately represented. In surface samples where both Ambrosia and Artemisia are reported as nonzero proportions of the pollen sum, mean annual precipitation explains approximately 78% of the variation in the log Ambrosia-to-Artemisia ratio. Application of this model to Little Ice Age pollen samples produces precipitation reconstructions which generally agree with reconstructions from independent non-pollen proxies. In addition, we find that modern ecoregions within the North American midcontinent can be successfully distinguished from one another using the log Ambrosia-to-Artemisia ratio. These relationships can improve reconstructions of past climate and improve delineation of past ecoregion boundaries.

X-ray diffraction analysis confirms no compositional degradation of the perovskite layer up to 200 degrees C anneals. We use a layer-by-layer vapor deposition technique with thin layers (several nanometers) of PbI2 and CsBr precursors to fabricate inorganic mixed halide perovskite solar cells with a photoconversion efficiency of 11.8%. We study the effect of several key parameters of the perovskite fabrication process that control the intermixing of the perovskite layer and their effect on device efficiency and hysteresis. The thermal stability of the perovskite material and its energy band gap of 1.87 eV makes it appropriate for use in tandem junction cells for use in real-life environments with high solar illuminance where the ambient temperatures exceed 55 degrees C in the summer, and silicon cell module temperatures approach 86 degrees C.

Music Form but Not Music Experience Modulates Motor Cortical Activity in Response to Novel Music	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						motor cortical excitability; music listening; music training; musicians and non-musicians; music experience	CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; REPETITIVE MOVEMENT; CORTEX EXCITABILITY; DOPAMINE; OSCILLATIONS; VARIABILITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULATION; PLASTICITY; FEEDBACK	External cues, such as music, improve movement performance in persons with Parkinson's disease. However, research examining the motor cortical mechanisms by which this occurs is lacking. Research using electroencephalography in healthy young adults has revealed that moving to music can modulate motor cortical activity. Moreover, motor cortical activity is further influenced by music experience. It remains unknown whether these effects extend to corticomotor excitability. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of novel music on corticomotor excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a pilot study of healthy young adults. A secondary aim of this study was to determine the influence of music experience on corticomotor excitability. We hypothesized that corticomotor excitability will change during music conditions, and that it will differ in those with formal music training. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous using single-pulse TMS in three conditions: (1) No Music, (2) Music Condition I, and (3) Music Condition II. Both pieces were set to novel MIDI piano instrumentation and part-writing conventions typical of early nineteenth-century Western classical practices. Results revealed Music Condition II (i.e., more relaxing music) compared to rest increased MEP amplitude (i.e., corticomotor excitability). Music Condition II as compared to Music Condition I (i.e., more activating music) reduced MEP variability (i.e., corticomotor variability). Finally, years of formal music training did not significantly influence corticomotor excitability while listening to music. Overall, results revealed that unfamiliar music modulates motor cortical excitability but is dependent upon the form of music and possibly music preference. These results will be used to inform planned studies in healthy older adults and people with Parkinson's disease.

Aeroelastic model tests to study tall building vibration in boundary-layer and tornado winds	ENGINEERING STRUCTURES			English	Article						Wind-induced vibration; Aeroelastic model test; Tall building response; CAARC tall building; ABL wind; Tornado wind	DOUBLE-SKIN FACADE; PROBABILISTIC APPROACH; RESPONSE ESTIMATION; LOAD DISTRIBUTIONS; 3D MODES; SIMULATION; PRESSURE; FLOW; CFD	A three-degree-of-freedom aeroelastic model of the standard CAARC Tall Building with a rectangular cross section was tested in both atmospheric-boundary-layer (ABL) wind tunnel and tornado simulator to assess its susceptibility to wind-induced vibration in straight-line wind and tornado wind and compare the two responses. Time histories of acceleration at roof-height and mid-height of the model were measured at different wind speeds. The normalized response of the tall building model was obtained with respect to reduced velocities at critical angles of attack for the boundary-layer wind and at critical locations and orientations with respect to the tornado path. The aerodynamic damping of the tall building was identified from the measurements and validated with other tests; furthermore, the results were analyzed in both time-domain and frequency-domain to reveal the response characteristics. A comparison of the vibration response shows that the characteristics of the tornado-induced excitation are different and its magnitudes are much more severe from those of the conventional straight-line wind. The results obtained from this study can be used to validate both wind-tunnel and numerical methodologies used for assessing the wind-induced vibration of a tall building and will eventually help to develop guidelines to reduce the wind-induced damage or occupant discomfort as a result of excessive vibration.

Cropping System Redesign for Improved Weed Management: A Modeling Approach Illustrated with Giant Ragweed (Ambrosia trifida)	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						crop rotation; giant ragweed; Ambrosia trifida; weed management; population dynamics models	LIVESTOCK SYSTEMS; SEED; RESISTANT; PREDATION; FECUNDITY; LOSSES	Weeds present important challenges to both conventional farmers who rely on herbicides and organic farmers who rely on cultivation. Data from field experiments indicate that diversifying crop sequences with additional species can improve weed suppression when either herbicides or cultivation serve as primary control tactics. Here, we report the results of modeling analyses that investigated how cropping system diversification would affect the population dynamics of giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida L.), an annual dicotyledonous species that is problematic in the central U.S. for both conventional and organic farmers. We found that to prevent an increase in giant ragweed density, the minimum control efficacy needed from herbicides or cultivation used in corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) would be 99.0% in a 2-year corn-soybean system, but 91.4% in a 5-year corn-soybean-rye (Secale cereale L.)-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) system. Thus, the diversified rotation would be better buffered against less-than-perfect weed control during corn and soybean phases. Further modeling analyses indicated that the weed suppression effect associated with greater rotation length was attributable not only to increased crop species richness but also to greater temporal variation in planting dates. A planting interval variation index (PIVI), calculated as the coefficient of variation in months between planting activities, was strongly associated with the weed suppressive ability of the rotations we modeled and may be a useful metric for designing other cropping systems. Overall, our results indicate that diversified rotation systems that include both annual and perennial crops are likely to be valuable for managing problematic weed species.

In this study, we examine the chromosomal and plasmid transcriptomes of two different L. monocytogenes strains, 6179 [belonging to sequence type (ST) 121] and R479a (ST8), in response to 30 min exposure to oxidative (0.01% hydrogen peroxide) and acid (1% lactic acid, pH 3.4) stress. The exposure to oxidative stress resulted in 102 and 9 differentially expressed (DE) genes in the chromosomal transcriptomes of 6179 and R479a, respectively. In contrast, 2280 and 2151 DE genes were observed in the respective chromosomal transcriptomes of 6179 and R479a in response to lactic acid stress. During lactic acid stress, we observed upregulation of numerous genes known to be involved in the L. monocytogenes stress response, including multiple members of the sigma(B) regulon, many of which have not been functionally characterized. Among these genes, homologs of lmo2230 were highly upregulated in both strains. Most notably, the sigma(B)-dependent non-coding RNA Rli47 was by far the most highly expressed gene in both 6179 and R479a, accounting for an average of 28 and 38% of all mapped reads in the respective chromosomal transcriptomes. In response to oxidative stress, one DE gene was identified in the 6179 plasmid transcriptome, and no DE genes were observed in the transcriptome of the R479a plasmid. However, lactic acid exposure resulted in upregulation of the stress response gene clpL, among others, on the 6179 plasmid. In R479a, a number of uncharacterized plasmid genes were upregulated, indicating a potential role in stress response. Furthermore, an average of 65% of all mapped transcriptome reads for the R479a plasmid following acid stress were mapped to an intergenic region bearing similarity to riboswitches involved in transition metal resistance. The results of this study support the conclusion that members of the sigma(B) regulon, particularly lmo2230 and the non-coding RNA Rli47, play an integral role in the response of L. monocytogenes to acid stress. Furthermore, we report the first global transcriptome sequencing analysis of L. monocytogenes plasmid gene expression and identify a putative, plasmid-encoded riboswitch with potential involvement in response to acid exposure.

Principal Galois orders and Gelfand-Zeitlin modules	ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Gelfand-Zeitlin theory; Invariant theory; Finite W-algebra; Quantum group	TSETLIN MODULES; CLASSICAL MECHANICS; PERSPECTIVE	We show that the ring of invariants in a skew monoid ring contains a so called standard Galois order. Any Galois ring contained in the standard Galois order is automatically itself a Galois order and we call such rings principal Galois orders. We give two applications. First, we obtain a simple sufficient criterion for a Galois ring to be a Galois order and hence for its Gelfand-Zeitlin subalgebra to be maximal commutative. Second, generalizing a recent result by Early-Mazorchuk-Vishnyakova, we construct canonical simple Gelfand-Zeitlin modules over any principal Galois order. As an example, we introduce the notion of a rational Galois order, attached an arbitrary finite reflection group and a set of rational difference operators, and show that they are principal Galois orders. Building on results by Futorny-Molev-Ovsienko, we show that parabolic subalgebras of finite W-algebras are rational Galois orders. Similarly we show that Mazorchuk's orthogonal Gelfand-Zeitlin algebras of type A, and their parabolic subalgebras, are rational Galois orders. Consequently we produce canonical simple Gelfand-Zeitlin modules for these algebras and prove that their Gelfand-Zeitlin subalgebras are maximal commutative. Lastly, we show that quantum OGZ algebras, previously defined by the author, and their parabolic subalgebras, are principal Galois orders. This in particular proves the long-standing Mazorchuk-Turowska conjecture that, if q is not a root of unity, the Gelfand-Zeitlin subalgebra of U-q(gl(n)) is maximal commutative and that its Gelfand-Zeitlin fibers are non-empty and (by Futorny-Ovsienko theory) finite.

Impact of viral disease hypophagia on pig jejunal function and integrity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RESPIRATORY SYNDROME VIRUS; EPIDEMIC DIARRHEA VIRUS; INTESTINAL INTEGRITY; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; BARRIER FUNCTION; WEANED PIGS; HEAT-STRESS; GUT HEALTH; CELL; CHALLENGE	Pathogen challenges are often accompanied by reductions in feed intake, making it difficult to differentiate impacts of reduced feed intake from impacts of pathogen on various response parameters. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the impact of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV) and feed intake on parameters of jejunal function and integrity in growing pigs. Twenty-four pigs (11.34 +/- 1.54 kg BW) were randomly selected and allotted to 1 of 3 treatments (n = 8 pigs/treatment): 1) PRRSV naive, ad libitum fed (Ad), 2) PRRSV-inoculated, ad libitum fed (PRRS+), and 3) PRRSV naive, pair-fed to the PRRS+ pigs' daily feed intake (PF). At 17 days post inoculation, all pigs were euthanized and the jejunum was collected for analysis. At days post inoculation 17, PRRS+ and PF pigs had decreased (P < 0.05) transepithelial resistance compared with Ad pigs; whereas fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4 kDa permeability was not different among treatments. Active glucose transport was increased (P < 0.05) in PRRS+ and PF pigs compared with Ad pigs. Brush border carbohydrase activity was reduced in PRRS+ pigs compared with PF pigs for lactase (55%; P = 0.015), sucrase (37%; P = 0.002), and maltase (30%; P = 0.015). For all three carbohydrases, Ad pigs had activities intermediate that of PRRS+ and PF pigs. The mRNA abundance of the tight junction proteins claudin 2, claudin 3, claudin 4, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 were reduced in PRRS+ pigs compared with Ad pigs; however, neither the total protein abundance nor the cellular compartmentalization of these tight junction proteins differed among treatments. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the changes that occur to intestinal epithelium structure, function, and integrity during a systemic PRRSV challenge can be partially explained by reductions in feed intake. Further, long term adaptation to PRRSV challenge and caloric restriction does reduce intestinal transepithelial resistance but does not appear to reduce the integrity of tight junction protein complexes.

Investigation of the effectiveness of a community-based parent education program to engage families in increasing language interactions with their children	EARLY CHILDHOOD RESEARCH QUARTERLY			English	Article						Early intervention; Language development; Parent engagement; Community-based research	PROPENSITY SCORE; COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; DIRECTED SPEECH; QUALITY; LITERACY; INPUT; INTERVENTIONS; KNOWLEDGE; SUPPORT; SKILLS	The home language environment (HLE) is robustly associated with children's later language and literacy abilities. The present study used a quasi-experimental comparison design to examine the changes in LENA (Language ENvironment Analysis) estimates of the HLE for participants who completed a community-based parent-education program relative to participants who regularly visit the library, but did not participate in the program. Twenty-eight caregivers and their 0- to 30-month-old children made up the comparison sample. They were matched on key control variables using propensity score matching techniques to participants in the intervention sample. The intervention sample was 28 caregivers and their children drawn from the larger sample of participants who completed the educational program. Using longitudinal growth curve modeling, we found significant growth in weekly estimates in adult language input to children, conversational turn-taking, and child vocalizations for the intervention group, but not for the comparison group. Community-delivered interventions have the potential to engage caregivers to provide enriching language environments that lead to children's healthy language development. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

More recently, modulo-imaging methods have been introduced for high dynamic range photography to significantly expand dynamic range at the sensing stage itself. The transformation function for both of these problems is highly non-linear, and the image reconstruction procedure is typically non-convex and ill-posed. A popular recent approach is to regularize the above inverse problem via a neural network prior (such as a trained autoencoder), but this requires extensive training over a dataset with thousands of paired regular/HDR image data samples. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for HDR image reconstruction using neural priors that require no training data. Specifically, we employ deep image priors, which have been successfully used for imaging problems such as denoising, super-resolution, inpainting and compressive sensing with promising performance gains over conventional regularization techniques. In this paper, we consider two different approaches to high dynamic range (HDR) imaging - gamma encoding and modulo encoding - and propose a combination of deep image prior and total variation (TV) regularization for reconstructing low-light images. We demonstrate the significant improvement achieved by both of these approaches as compared to traditional dynamic range enhancement techniques.

Effects of Supplemental Light Source on Basil, Dill, and Parsley Growth, Morphology, Aroma, and Flavor	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						culinary herbs; light-emitting diodes; greenhouse; controlled environment	HIGH-PRESSURE SODIUM; SWEET BASIL; BLUE-LIGHT; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; RESPONSES; FLAVONOIDS; BIOSYNTHESIS; IRRADIANCE; EXPRESSION; INTENSITY	Broad-spectrum high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps are the standard for greenhouse supplemental lighting. However, narrow-spectra light-emitting diodes (LEDs) offer potential benefits for enhancing growth, photosynthesis (P-n), and secondary metabolites in culinary herbs. Our objective was to quantify the effect of supplemental light source and spectra on growth, gas exchange, aroma, and flavor of culinary herbs. Basil (Ocimum basilicum 'Nufar'), dill (Anethum graveolens Ternleaf), and parsley (Petroselinum crispum 'Giant of Italy') were transplanted into hydroponic systems in a glass-glazed greenhouse. Plants were provided with a supplemental photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) density of 100 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) from an HPS lamp or LEDs with a low blue (B) to red (R) light ratio of 7:93 [low blue (LB)] or high B:R at 30:70 [high blue (HB)]. Compared with plants grown under HPS lamps, basil grown under LB and HB LED lighting was shorter, while only HB-grown parsley was shorter; height of dill was unaffected by light source. Basil and parsley shoot fresh weight was lower for HB-treated plants compared with HPS, though dill was unaffected by supplemental light source. Shoot dry mass of basil, dill, and parsley was unaffected by light source. Both LED treatments increased for basil and parsley compared with HPS-grown plants. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) was higher under LB and HB for basil compared with HPS in the morning and evening, but only HB-treated parsley was higher than HPS lighting in morning. Basil grown under LB, and parsley under both LEDs had lower chlorophyll fluorescence than those under HPS by the evening, but all three species had more chlorophyll b under LB light than HPS. Essential oil and phenolic accumulation were influenced by supplemental light treatment and responses varied among species. Lighting from LEDs resulted in a 2-fold increase in orientin and myristicin for basil and dill, respectively, while HB increased dillapiole concentration by 89% compared with HPS-grown dill. Notably, quercetin concentration was 2.8 times higher in dill grown under HB compared with HPS. Myrcene increased in all three species under either one (basil HB; dill LB) or both (parsley) LED lights compared with HPS. The increased content of aromatic and flavor compounds demonstrates the potential of supplemental lighting systems using specific wavelengths to add value; but the use of supplemental lighting requires an understanding of the additional stress on the photosynthetic mechanisms and the subsequent effect on biomass accumulation.

Therefore, obtaining accurate derivative information is crucial. Although many derivative estimation methods exist, the majority require a fixed design assumption. In this paper, we propose an effective and fully data-driven framework to estimate the first and second order derivative in random design. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed derivative estimator, and also propose a fast selection method for the tuning parameters.

Existing architectures can be classified as direct learning architectures (DLA) or indirect learning architectures (ILA). DLAs first learn a model of the device and then determine a pre-distorter by either directly inverting the device model or estimating a pre-inverse of the model. The RLA is similar to a DLA, but rather than learning a model of the device, the RLA uses fixed-point iteration to determine a set of input/output pairs which characterize the device. These pairs are then used to estimate the pre-distorter by redirecting learning from the device to the pre-distorter. The fixed-point iteration is shown to converge under a mild condition. Simulation of a class AB power amplifier reveals improved suppression of harmonic distortion compared to a pth order inverse approach.

TOR mediates the autophagy response to altered nucleotide homeostasis in an RNase mutant	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Article						Arabidopsis; autophagy; inosine; nucleotides; RNase; RNS2; rRNA; target of rapamycin (TOR)	ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; CYSTIC LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY; ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG; RAPAMYCIN KINASE; TARGET; GROWTH; DEGRADATION; PYRIMIDINE; STRESS; PURINE	The Arabidopsis thaliana T2 family endoribonuclease RNS2 localizes to the vacuole and functions in rRNA degradation. Loss of RNS2 activity impairs rRNA turnover and leads to constitutive autophagy, a process for degradation of cellular components. Autophagy is normally activated during environmental stress and is important for stress tolerance and homeostasis. Here we show that restoration of cytosolic purine nucleotide levels rescues the constitutive autophagy phenotype of rns2-2 seedlings, whereas inhibition of purine synthesis induces autophagy in wild-type seedlings. rns2-2 seedlings have reduced activity of the target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase complex, a negative regulator of autophagy, and this phenotype is rescued by addition of inosine to increase purine levels. Activation of TOR in rns2-2 by exogenous auxin blocks the enhanced autophagy, indicating a possible involvement of the TOR signaling pathway in the activation of autophagy in the rns2-2 mutant. Our data suggest a model in which loss of rRNA degradation in rns2-2 leads to a reduction in cytoplasmic nucleotide concentrations, which in turn inhibits TOR activity, leading to activation of autophagy to restore homeostasis.

Although these discoveries of wrongful convictions from mistaken identification based on DNA testing have been a surprise and shock to the legal system and the public, psychological scientists have been less surprised. This is because psychological scientists were "blowing the whistle" on the eyewitness identification problem for decades prior to forensic DNA testing. Today, most law enforcement agencies in the United States have adopted reformed policies and procedures on eyewitness identification that are based on research by experimental social and cognitive psychologists.

The semi-discrete scheme is shown to conserve mass, preserve solution positivity, and satisfy a discrete free energy dissipation law for nonuniform meshes. These properties for the fully-discrete scheme (first order in time) remain preserved without a strict restriction on time steps. For the fully second order (in both time and space) scheme, a local scaling limiter is introduced to restore solution positivity when necessary. It is proved that such limiter does not destroy the second order accuracy. In addition, these schemes are easy to implement, and efficient in simulations. Both one and two dimensional numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of these schemes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Molecularly imprinted nanoparticle receptors were prepared with glycans directly cleaved from glycoproteins. Functionalized with boroxole groups in the binding sites, these water-soluble synthetic lectins bound the parent glycoproteins selectively in water with an association constant ofK(a)= 10(4)-10(5)M(-1). The strong binding enabled the receptors to protect the targeted glycans from enzymatic cleavage. When clicked onto magnetic nanoparticles, the receptors enabled facile isolation of glycoproteins from a mixture.

We find significant evidence of opportunistic insider trading, with insiders saving an average of $35,009 due to timely selling in the three months before the announcement of a cybersecurity breach. Late filing violations by insiders are more likely to occur near the announcement of a cyber breach. The bulk of opportunistic trading tends to occur 55-72 days before the public announcement. The results lend support to the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's recently announced goal of tightening restrictions on insider trading ahead of cyber breach announcements.

Our data are measures of sheet and rill erosion called Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation-2 (RUSLE2). Small area estimates of mean RUSLE2 erosion are of interest. We use a zero-inflated lognormal mixed effects model for small area estimation. The model combines a unit-level lognormal model for the positive RUSLE2 responses with a unit-level logistic mixed effects model for the binary indicator that the response is nonzero. In the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) data, counties with a higher probability of nonzero responses also tend to have a higher mean among the positive RUSLE2 values. We capture this property of the data through an assumption that the pair of random effects for a county are correlated. We develop empirical Bayes (EB) small area predictors and a bootstrap estimator of the mean squared error (MSE). In simulations, the proposed predictor is superior to simpler alternatives. We then apply the method to construct EB predictors of mean RUSLE2 erosion for South Dakota counties. To obtain auxiliary variables for the population of cropland in South Dakota, we integrate a satellite-derived land cover map with a geographic database of soil properties. We provide an R Shiny application calledviscover(available at ) to visualize the overlay operations required to construct the covariates. On the basis of bootstrap estimates of the mean square error, we conclude that the EB predictors of mean RUSLE2 erosion are superior to direct estimators.

Previous research indicates that men are more likely than women to include agentic themes in their narrative identities, whereas women are more likely than men to include communal themes. The present investigation examined whether feminist identity would moderate the effects of gender on the degree to which participants included agentic and communal themes in their narrative identities. U.S. undergraduates (n = 170) completed measures of feminist beliefs in the laboratory, and then later wrote six essays describing various chapters of their life story as a measure of narrative identity. We coded each essay for agentic and communal thematic content. Consistent with previous research, gender predicted thematic content of essays; however, the gender effect on agentic themes was moderated by the degree to which individuals identified as feminists. For individuals lower in feminist identity, agentic thematic content of essays was consistent with previously reported gender differences; however, for individuals higher in feminist identity, the relationship between gender and agentic thematic content was attenuated. The effect of feminist identity on thematic content was maintained even when controlling for self-reported agentic traits.

J	Ramsay, T				Ramsay, Travis			Uncertainty Quantification of an Explicitly Coupled Multiphysics Simulation of In-Situ Pyrolysis by Radio Frequency Heating in Oil Shale	SPE JOURNAL			English	Article							THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; RESERVOIR; KEROGEN; MODEL; FLOW	In-situ pyrolysis provides an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique for exploiting oil and gas from oil shale by converting in-place solid kerogen into liquid oil and gas. Radio-frequency (RF) heating of the in-place oil shale has previously been proposed as a method by which the electromagnetic energy gets converted to thermal energy, thereby heating in-situ kerogen so that it converts to oil and gas. In order to numerically model the RF heating of the in-situ oil shale, a novel explicitly coupled thermal, phase field, mechanical, and electromagnetic (TPME) framework is devised using the finite element method in a 2D domain. Contemporaneous efforts in the commercial development of oil shale by in-situ pyrolysis have largely focused on pilot methodologies intended to validate specific corporate or esoteric EOR strategies. This work focuses on addressing efficient epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) of select thermal, oil shale distribution, electromagnetic, and mechanical characteristics of oil shale in the RF heating process, comparing a spectral methodology to a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for validation. Attempts were made to parameterize the stochastic simulation models using the characteristic properties of Green River oil shale. The geologic environment being investigated is devised as a kerogen-poor under- and overburden separated by a layer of heterogeneous yet kerogen-rich oil shale in a target formation. The objective of this work is the quantification of plausible oil shale conversion using TPME simulation under parametric uncertainty; this, while considering a referenced conversion timeline of 1.0 x 10(7) seconds. Nonintrusive polynomial chaos (NIPC) and MC simulation were used to evaluate complex stochastically driven TPME simulations of RF heating. The least angle regression (LAR) method was specifically used to determine a sparse set of polynomial chaos coefficients leading to the determination of summary statistics that describe the TPME results. Given the existing broad use of MC simulation methods for UQ in the oil and gas industry, the combined LAR and NIPC is suggested to provide a distinguishable performance improvement to UQ compared to MC methods.

The effects of repetitive bouts of a fatiguing exertion (with breaks) on the slope of EMG measures of localized muscle fatigue	JOURNAL OF ELECTROMYOGRAPHY AND KINESIOLOGY			English	Article							MEDIAN FREQUENCY; CONDUCTION-VELOCITY; RECOVERY; ENDURANCE; PH	Decreases in the median frequency of the power spectrum and increases in amplitude measures of an electromyographic signal have been used to assess localized muscle fatigue. How these responses are affected by repetitive bouts of exertions - separated by rest breaks - is not well understood. It was hypothesized that repetitive bouts of a fatiguing, isometric exertion, separated by periods of rest, would have cumulative effects (across bouts) on the slope of these EMG-based variables, with an expectation of a steeper rate of decline in the median frequency and a steeper rate of increase in amplitude measures in subsequent bouts. To test these hypotheses, 24 participants performed four bouts of an isometric (15% MVC) elbow flexion exertion. Each exertion lasted for four minutes and then a 15-minute break was provided between bouts. Surface electromyography was used to capture the activity of the biceps brachii at twenty-second intervals during the exertions. The median frequency and average rectified value were calculated, as were the slopes of these variables within each of the four-minute bouts. Contrary to the original hypotheses, the results showed that there were no statistically significant differences in the slopes of these EMG-based measures across bouts. One direction for future work is to explore different combinations of work-rest durations to refine this response while another may be to explore alternate EMG-based measures of muscular fatigue that may be more sensitive to this cumulative effect.

Here, we investigate a simple strategy for achieving high-energy in-plane orbitals for aromatics simply by positioning iodine atoms next to each other. The lone pair orbitals on the iodines mix to give a high-energy in-plane sigma-antibonding orbital as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). We show that this effect can be used to manipulate orbital gaps, the symmetry of the highest occupied orbital, and the adopted electronic state for reactive intermediates. This electronic effect is not limited to reactive intermediates, and we demonstrate that this iodine buttressing strategy also can be used to achieve small HOMO-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gaps in organic electronic materials. Iodinated oligomers of several of the most popular conducting polymers are computed to have smaller HOMO-LUMO gaps than the unsubstituted materials. This iodine buttressing approach for generating high-energy in-plane HOMOs is anticipated to be highly general. While the unusual properties of fluorous materials are well established, at the other extreme on the periodic table novel properties of iodous materials may await discovery.

We propose a method for comparing two shoe outsole impressions that relies on robust features (speeded-up robust feature; SURF) on each impression and aligns them using a maximum clique (MC). After alignment, an algorithm we denote MC-COMP is used to extract additional features that are then combined into a univariate similarity score using a random forest (RF). We use a database of shoe outsole impressions that includes images from two models of athletic shoes that were purchased new and then worn by study participants for about 6 months. The shoes share class characteristics such as outsole pattern and size, and thus the comparison is challenging. We find that the RF implemented on SURF outperforms other methods recently proposed in the literature in terms of classification precision. In more realistic scenarios where crime scene impressions may be degraded and smudged, the algorithm we propose-denoted MC-COMP-SURF-shows the best classification performance by detecting unique features better than other methods. The algorithm can be implemented with the R-package shoeprintr.

Design of monophasic pulsed magnetic fields for use in low bias fields	AIP ADVANCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	64th Annual Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials (MMM)	NOV 04-08, 2019	Las Vegas, NV					In this work, the design of a pulsed magnetic field generator, with user-selective pulsed modulation frequency is described. The ability to operate at various frequencies (single-frequency below 10 MHz) makes the system valuable to several areas such as medical treatments and pulsed switching systems. In this work, the pulsed magnetic field generator is designed to create localized field effects in portable magnetic resonance systems. Users may operate at a Larmor precession frequency between 100 kHz - 10 MHz and can achieve high currents through the load.

Exercise-Induced Adaptations to the Mouse Striatal Adenosine System	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Article							MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTOR; LEARNED HELPLESSNESS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; A(2A) RECEPTORS; DISTINCT ROLES; A(1) RECEPTORS; STRESSOR CONTROLLABILITY; UNCONTROLLABLE STRESS; ESCAPE PERFORMANCE	Adenosine acts as a key regulator of striatum activity, in part, through the antagonistic modulation of dopamine activity. Exercise can increase adenosine activity in the brain, which may impair dopaminergic functions in the striatum. Therefore, long-term repeated bouts of exercise may subsequently generate plasticity in striatal adenosine systems in a manner that promotes dopaminergic activity. This study investigated the effects of long-term voluntary wheel running on adenosine 1 (A(1)R), adenosine 2A (A(2A)R), dopamine 1 (D1R), and dopamine 2 (D2R) receptor protein expression in adult mouse dorsal and ventral striatum structures using immunohistochemistry. In addition, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) protein expression was examined after wheel running, as ENT1 regulates the bidirectional flux of adenosine between intra- and extracellular space. The results suggest that eight weeks of running wheel access spared age-related increases of A(1)R and A(2A)R protein concentrations across the dorsal and ventral striatal structures. Wheel running mildly reduced ENT1 protein levels in ventral striatum subregions. Moreover, wheel running mildly increased D2R protein density within striatal subregions in the dorsal medial striatum, nucleus accumbens core, and the nucleus accumbens shell. However, D1R protein expression in the striatum was unchanged by wheel running. These data suggest that exercise promotes adaptations to striatal adenosine systems. Exercise-reduced A(1)R and A(2A)R and exercise-increased D2R protein levels may contribute to improved dopaminergic signaling in the striatum. These findings may have implications for cognitive and behavioral processes, as well as motor and psychiatric diseases that involve the striatum.

Albumin Levels in Tear Film Modulate the Bioavailability of Medically-Relevant Topical Drugs	FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						albumin; blood-tear barrier; protein-binding; dog; bioavailability; ocular surface	PLASMA-PROTEIN BINDING; 0.005-PERCENT LATANOPROST; INTRAOCULAR-PRESSURE; TROPICAMIDE; EYE; DELIVERY; PROSTAGLANDINS; MODEL; IRIS	The breakdown of blood-tear barrier that occurs with ocular pathology allows for large amounts of albumin to leak into the tear fluid. This process likely represents an important restriction to drug absorption in ophthalmology, as only the unbound drug is transported across the ocular tissue barriers to exert its pharmacologic effect. We aimed to investigate the effects of albumin levels in tears on the bioavailability of two commonly used ophthalmic drugs: tropicamide, an antimuscarinic that produces mydriasis and cycloplegia, and latanoprost, a PGF2 alpha analog used for the treatment of glaucoma. Eight female beagle dogs underwent a randomized, vehicle-controlled crossover trial. For each dog, one eye received 30 mu l of artificial tears (control) or canine albumin (0.4 or 1.5%) at random, immediately followed by 30 mu l of 1% tropicamide (2 days, 24 h washout) or 0.005% latanoprost (2 days, 72 h washout) in both eyes. Pupil diameter (digital caliper) and intraocular pressure (IOP; rebound tonometry) were recorded at various times following drug administration (0 to 480 min) and compared between both groups with a mixed model for repeated measures. Albumin in tears had a significant impact on pupillary diameter for both tropicamide (P <= 0.001) and latanoprost (P <= 0.047), with no differences noted between 0.4% and 1.5% concentrations. Reduction in the maximal effect (pupil size) and overall drug exposure (area under the effect time-curve of pupil size over time) were significant for tropicamide (6.2-8.5% on average, P <= 0.006) but not for latanoprost (P >= 0.663). The IOP, only measured in eyes receiving latanoprost, was not significantly impacted by the addition of either 0.4% (P = 0.242) or 1.5% albumin (P = 0.879). Albumin in tear film, previously shown to leak from the conjunctival vasculature in diseased eyes, may bind to topically administered drugs and reduces their intraocular penetration and bioavailability. Further investigations in clinical patients and other commonly used ophthalmic medications are warranted.

A CNN-RNN Framework for Crop Yield Prediction	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						crop yield prediction; deep learning; convolutional neural networks; recurrent neural networks; feature selection	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PLANTING DATE; MODEL	Crop yield prediction is extremely challenging due to its dependence on multiple factors such as crop genotype, environmental factors, management practices, and their interactions. This paper presents a deep learning framework using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for crop yield prediction based on environmental data and management practices. The proposed CNN-RNN model, along with other popular methods such as random forest (RF), deep fully connected neural networks (DFNN), and LASSO, was used to forecast corn and soybean yield across the entire Corn Belt (including 13 states) in the United States for years 2016, 2017, and 2018 using historical data. The new model achieved a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) 9% and 8% of their respective average yields, substantially outperforming all other methods that were tested. The CNN-RNN has three salient features that make it a potentially useful method for other crop yield prediction studies. (1) The CNN-RNN model was designed to capture the time dependencies of environmental factors and the genetic improvement of seeds over time without having their genotype information. (2) The model demonstrated the capability to generalize the yield prediction to untested environments without significant drop in the prediction accuracy. (3) Coupled with the backpropagation method, the model could reveal the extent to which weather conditions, accuracy of weather predictions, soil conditions, and management practices were able to explain the variation in the crop yields.

This work proposes and provides a proof-of-concept for a hybrid spatial- and frequency-domain approach that combines frequency-domain information of the resonators of chipless RFID tags with microwave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging. In this way, the tag resonators can serve a dual identification and sensing purpose allowing for tags to become more information-dense. In this proof-of-concept investigation, the manner by which SAR imaging can be used to verify tag performance, perform embedded materials characterization, and better understand the tag environment is examined, and the limitations of this hybrid approach resulting from image resolution are explored.

Model Compression on Faulty Array-based Neural Network Accelerator	2020 IEEE 25TH PACIFIC RIM INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DEPENDABLE COMPUTING (PRDC 2020)	IEEE Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	25th IEEE Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing (IEEE PRDC)	DEC 01-04, 2020	Perth, AUSTRALIA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Dependable Comp & Fault Tolerance		Systolic Array; Deep Neural Networks; Accelerators; Faults; Model Compression; Pruning		Due to an increase in the size of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), special purpose hardware has gained prominence to accelerate the forward pass of the network like Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) and Eyeriss. The heart of these accelerators is a Matrix Multiplication unit, which is based on systolic array architecture. This array processor has a grid-like structure, made of individual Processing Elements (PEs) that can be extended along row and column. A lot of work has been done on the computing array implementation and its reliability concerns in the past. However, their fault tolerance perspective with respect to DNNs is not yet fully understood with a fault model. We, in this paper, first present a fault model i.e., different sequences in which faults can occur on the array. We classify the fault modes into random, row, and column, and study their impact on the accuracy of DNNs followed by overheads of the mitigation strategies. Pruning is a process of removing redundant parameters in the model to decrease the network size for efficient performance. Although several pruning techniques have been developed to reduce the inference time on general-purpose and special-purpose systems, model compression (pruning) under faulty scenario has not yet been explored. In the second part of our work, we co-design a Fault based and Array size based Pruning (FPAP) algorithm with an intent of bypassing the faults and removing the internal redundancy at the same time for efficient inference. We compare our method with recent pruning methods under different fault scenarios and array sizes. We achieve a mean speedup of 4.2x where the baselines achieved 1.6x on ConvNet, NiN, AlexNet, VGG16 over Eyeriss in the case of random faults.

The material was an alloy of Pb, Cs, Br and I. By using an inorganic cation perovskite we eliminated the thermal instability associated with organic cations such as methyl-amine and formamidine. X-ray measurements reveal that there is no change in the composition even when the material is annealed at 300 degrees C after growth, in marked contrast with the case for a material with organic cations which decompose after anneals at 100 degrees C-125 degrees C. Thermal stability is important when perovskite solar cells are to be deployed in real life desert environments where the ambient temperatures approach 50 degrees C and the cell temperatures approach 100 degrees C. Superstrate devices in n-i-p configuration were prepared using an inorganic n layer (CdS) and an organic p layer (P3HT), and the devices were also thermally stable up to an anneal of 300 degrees C. Adding Br to I significantly improved the stability against moisture, and also makes the material stable at all temperatures between room temperature and 350 degrees C, while increasing the bandgap to 1.87 eV range, which is suitable for making a tandem cell with Si or CIGS. Device efficiencies of similar to 12% were achieved with an excellent uniformity of performance between various devices. Detailed measurements of fundamental properties such as defect densities and Urbach energies of tail states were made and show low mid-gap defect densities in the range of 1015/cm3-eV with a peak at 0.53 eV below the conduction band and Urbach energy in the range of 20 meV.

UTILIZING A FULL-SCALE, INTERACTIVE, VIRTUAL REALITY APPLICATION TO ENHANCE SYSTEMS' MENTAL MODELS IN TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING STUDENTS	14TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED2020)	INTED Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)	MAR 02-04, 2020	Valencia, SPAIN			Virtual Reality; Mental Models		Technology and engineering students need to evolve a sense of what industrial systems are in order to be able to grasp various functionalities of systems in the industry. Johan de Kleer and his colleagues termed this sense as 'Mechanistic Mental Models' and described it as "the common intuition of 'simulating the machines in the mind's eye'." The author herein teaches a course titled 'Risk Analysis and Management' at Iowa State University (USA). The course heavily focuses on analyzing systems for risk and introducing barriers to control the risk. Conducting risk assessments on systems require familiarity with all aspects of systems, including how they operate and their relationship to the environment. Visualizing systems on 2D schematic drawings is the most common exposure to systems. However, 2D schematic drawings more often add confusion rather than help students evolve proper mental models of systems. To address this concern, the author and his research team developed a full-scale, 3D, highly interactive virtual reality application titled Construct Virtual Reality (CVR). Students can use CVR to interact with systems and to design and build systems for desired industrial applications. To assess whether working with CVR promotes developing proper mental models for systems, students used CVR in the following two settings: (1) interacting with a virtual system that was already built in CVR; and, (2) using CVR to design and build a system for a specific industrial application. Students' mental models were assessed after exposure to each one of the settings above. Order of exposure to the two settings were alternated to control for order bias. Mental models were assessed along the following four dimensions: (1) System topology: the structure of the system (2) Envisioning: the inference process of determining the purpose or functionality of each component in the system (3) Casual model: the ability to describe the overall function of the system in terms of how the components interact (4) Running/Simulation: the ability to conduct mental simulation and anticipate system's behavior. The overall mental models are synthesized from the dimensions above. Then, the utility of CVR as a platform for enhancing systems' mental models in this student population is documented and discussed.

J	Moeinizade, S; Wellner, M; Hu, GP; Wang, LZ				Moeinizade, Saba; Wellner, Megan; Hu, Guiping; Wang, Lizhi			Complementarity-based selection strategy for genomic selection	CROP SCIENCE			English	Article							SEXUAL SELECTION; FOOD SECURITY	Genomic selection is a technique that breeders use to select plant or animal individuals to mate and produce new generations of species. The conventional selection method is to select individuals that are either observed or predicted to be the best based on the assumption that parents with better phenotypes will produce better offspring. A major limitation of this method is its focus on the short-term genetic gains at the cost of genetic diversity and long-term growth potential. Recently, several new genomic selection methods were proposed to maximize the long-term potential. Along this research direction, we propose a new method, the complementarity-based selection strategy (CBS), to improve the tradeoff between short-term genetic gain and long-term potential. This approach is inspired by the genetic compatibility mate-choice mechanism in animals. Our selection method selects the individual with the highest genomic estimated breeding value to emphasize short-term achievement and then pairs it with the individual that is the most complementary to the one with highest genomic estimated breeding value to emphasize the long-term growth potential. The CBS method allows favorable alleles to be accounted for within the selection and more of them to be included. We present simulation results that compare the performance of the new method against the state-of-the-art methods in the literature and show that the CBS approach has a great potential to further improve long-term response in genomic selection.

Prequestions Enhance Learning, but Only When They Are Remembered	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-APPLIED			English	Article						prequestions; testing; memory; education; learning	SELECTIVE ATTENTION STRATEGY; READING TIME; TEXT; QUESTIONS; RETENTION; RELEVANCE	Answering prequestions benefits learning, but this benefit is mostly specific to material that was relevant to the prequestions (prequestioned material) and does not extend to other, nonprequestioned material. The current study examined whether this specific benefit is due to selective processing of prequestioned information during a learning experience. In 4 experiments, participants were assigned to a prequestion group or control group before viewing a 30-min video lecture. In Experiment 2, participants were instructed to take notes on information they thought was important during the video; in Experiment 3, the prequestion group was instructed to write down the answers to the prequestions; and in Experiment 4, the prequestion group was given the prequestions and instructed to answer them while viewing the video. On a later posttest in all experiments, the prequestion group outperformed the control group, but only for prequestioned material. Further, this benefit only occurred when the prequestion group successfully discovered the answers to the prequestions during the video by writing them down (Experiments 2 and 3) or circling them (Experiment 4). These results suggest that prequestion benefits depend on the degree to which participants can successfully notice and discover the answers to the prequestioned material during a video lecture.

J	Su, WJ; Zuo, T; Peterson, T				Su, Weijia; Zuo, Tao; Peterson, Thomas			Ectopic Expression of a Maize Gene Is Induced by Composite Insertions Generated Through Alternative Transposition	GENETICS			English	Article						transposable elements; alternative transposition; composite insertion; enhancer	DOUBLE-STRAND BREAKS; TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS; VARIEGATED PERICARP; DNA METHYLATION; REARRANGEMENTS; ENHANCER; UPSTREAM; DISTANCE; REPAIR; SERIES	Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences that can mobilize and proliferate throughout eukaryotic genomes. Previous studies have shown that in plant genomes, TEs can influence gene expression in various ways, such as inserting in introns or exons to alter transcript structure and content, and providing novel promoters and regulatory elements to generate new regulatory patterns. Furthermore, TEs can also regulate gene expression at the epigenetic level by modifying chromatin structure, changing DNA methylation status, and generating small RNAs. In this study, we demonstrated that Ac/fractured Ac (fAc) TEs are able to induce ectopic gene expression by duplicating and shuffling enhancer elements. Ac/fAc elements belong to the hAT family of class II TEs. They can undergo standard transposition events, which involve the two termini of a single transposon, or alternative transposition events that involve the termini of two different nearby elements. Our previous studies have shown that alternative transposition can generate various genome rearrangements such as deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations, and composite insertions (CIs). We identified >50 independent cases of CIs generated by Ac/fAc alternative transposition and analyzed 10 of them in detail. We show that these CIs induced ectopic expression of the maize pericarp color 2 (p2) gene, which encodes a Myb-related protein. All the CIs analyzed contain sequences including a transcriptional enhancer derived from the nearby p1 gene, suggesting that the CI-induced activation of p2 is affected by mobilization of the p1 enhancer. This is further supported by analysis of a mutant in which the CI is excised and p2 expression is lost. These results show that alternative transposition events are not only able to induce genome rearrangements, but also generate CIs that can control gene expression.

Application of Hydroprocessing, Fermentation, and Anaerobic Digestion in a Carbon-Negative Pyrolysis Refinery	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article						fast pyrolysis; hydroprocessing; anaerobic digestion; fermentation; techno-economic analysis; life cycle analysis		This study investigates the economic and environmental benefits of integrating hydroprocessing, fermentation, and anaerobic digestion into a pyrolysis refinery. Two scenarios were developed for upgrading and/or utilizing the primary products of pyrolysis (bio-oil, gas, and char). The first (hydroprocessing) scenario hydroprocesses whole bio-oil into gasoline and diesel. The second (fractionation) scenario fractionates bio-oil into sugars for fermentation to cellulosic ethanol and residual phenolic oil as the primary product. Both scenarios use the gaseous product of pyrolysis for process heat in the plant and employ biochar to enhance anaerobic digestion of manure for power generation. The fast pyrolysis plant processes 2000 ton/day of corn stover while the anaerobic digester employs 430 ton/day of manure to generate power. The hydroprocessing scenario produces gasoline at a minimum fuel-selling price (MFSP) of $2.77 per gallons of gasoline while the fractionation scenario produces ethanol and phenolic oils (diesel) as a transportation fuel for $1.2 per gallon ($1.41 per GGE). Sensitivity analysis indicates that the MFSP for both scenarios is highly sensitive to the fixed capital cost. Fixed capital costs for the hydroprocessing and fractionation scenarios were estimated to be $643 and $288 million, respectively. Fuel production rates for the hydroprocessing and fractionation scenarios are 60.5 and 16 million GGE per year, respectively. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions were calculated as -9.6 and -16.6 g CO2,eq per MJ for the hydroprocessing and fractionation scenarios, respectively. LCA emissions are sensitive to byproduct credits derived from biochar sequestration and power generation. This study shows that both systems produce transportation fuels at competitive market prices with an additional reduction in atmospheric CO2 levels compared to fossil fuel sources.

The positive association between socialization experiences (i.e., racial teasing and appearance-focused social pressure) and the outcome variable (i.e., consideration of cosmetic surgery) was hypothesized to be mediated by self-objectification processes (i.e., internalization of beauty standards, body surveillance, and lower body esteem). Results using path analysis showed that culturally dominant (United States) and culturally specific (Asian) internalization of beauty standards, culturally dominant (United States) and culturally specific (Asian) body surveillance, and lower body esteem were significant mediators between socialization experiences and consideration of cosmetic surgery. A multiple-group analysis demonstrated equivalence of the model for Asian international and Asian American female students, showing that both dominant and culturally specific beauty standards may contribute to self-objectification processes for this population.

Effects of Levodopa on Impairments to High-Level Vision in Parkinson's Disease	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						line discrimination; object discrimination; facial discrimination; visual working memory; object rotation	SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; MENTAL ROTATION; VISUAL DYSFUNCTION; DOPAMINE; DEFICITS; ATROPHY; PERFORMANCE; EXPRESSION; NETWORK	Studies have reported that Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with impairments on cognitive visual tasks. However, the effects of dopamine on cognitive vision remain equivocal. The purpose of this study was to examine performance on cognitive vision tasks in persons with PD and the effects of levodopa on these tasks. Fourteen individuals with PD and 14 age- and sex-matched healthy older adults completed the study. Participants with PD completed the visual tasks following a 12-h withdrawal of dopaminergic medication and again 1 h after taking 1.5 times their normal dose of levodopa. Healthy older adults completed the visual tasks twice using the same session format. Five complex visual tasks were completed, including line discrimination, object discrimination, facial discrimination, visual working memory, and object rotation. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale was also collected off and on medication. Participants with PD performed significantly worse than the healthy older adults across all five visual tasks. There were no significant differences in performance between the off and on medication state in persons with PD. This finding indicates either that dopamine deficiency may not be responsible for cognitive visual impairments in PD or that cognitive visual impairments in PD might simply be the result of deficits in more basic visual processing.

When these microbubbles (MBs) collapse, shock waves are radiated outward and are known to damage surrounding materials in other applications, like the steel foundation of boat propellers, so it is alarming to realize the damage that cavitation inflicts on vulnerable brain tissue. Using cell-laden microfibers, the longitudinal morphological response that mouse astrocytes have to surrounding cavitation in vitro is visually analyzed. Astrocytic damage is evident immediately after cavitation when compared to a control sample, as their processes retract. Forty-eight hours later, the astrocytes appeared to spread across the fibers, as normal. This study also analyzes the gene expression changes that occur post-cavitation via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods. After cavitation a number of pro-inflammatory genes are upregulated, including TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, C1q, Serping1, NOS1, IL-6, and JMJD3. Taken together, these results confirm that surrounding cavitation is detrimental to astrocytic function, and yield opportunities to further the understanding of how protective headgear can minimize or eliminate the occurrence of cavitation.

Engelberg and H. Liu and E. Tadmor, Indiana Univ. Math. J. 50 (2001) 109-157]. A simple transformation is used to linearize the characteristic system of equations, which allows us to study the geometrical structure of critical threshold curves for three damping cases: overdamped, underdamped and borderline damped through phase plane analysis. We also derive the explicit form of these critical curves. These sharp results state that if the initial data is within the threshold region, the solution will remain smooth for all time, otherwise it will have a finite time breakdown. Finally, we apply these general results to identify critical thresholds for a non-local system subjected to initial data on the whole line.

Dynamical Decomposition of Bilinear Control Systems Subject to Symmetries	JOURNAL OF DYNAMICAL AND CONTROL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Decomposition of dynamics; Symmetries; Applications of representation theory to control; Bilinear systems on Lie groups; Control of quantum mechanical systems	CONTROLLABILITY	We describe a method to analyze and decompose the dynamics of a bilinear control system subject to symmetries. The method is based on the concept of generalized Young symmetrizers of representation theory. It naturally applies to the situation where the system evolves on a tensor product space and there exists a finite group of symmetries for the dynamics which interchanges the various factors. This is the case for quantum mechanical multipartite systems, such as spin networks, where each factor of the tensor product represents the state of one of the component systems. We present several examples of application.

Observations Show That Wind Farms Substantially Modify the Atmospheric Boundary Layer Thermal Stratification Transition in the Early Evening	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						wind farm; evening transition; boundary layer; stratification; shear and buoyancy; tall tower measurements	LOW-LEVEL JETS; TURBINE WAKES; SURFACE-LAYER; TURBULENCE; ENERGY; AFTERNOON; IMPACTS; MODEL; HEAT; FLUX	Single wind turbines and large wind farms modify local scales of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) turbulence through different mechanisms dependent on location within the wind farm. These changes in turbulence scales would most likely have notable influence on surface fluxes and microclimate during the afternoon and early evening stability transition. Profiles of Richardson number and shear and buoyancy from 1-Hz tall tower measurements in and near a wind farm in an agricultural landscape were used to quantify departures in stability characteristics during the fallow seasons. A single turbine wake decoupled turbulent connection between the surface and above the wind turbine, changed the onset of near-surface stabilization (earlier by a few hours), and lengthened the transition period (by up to an hour) within the rotor wake. Deep within a large wind farm, turbulence recovered to near-ambient conditions and departures of the transition onset and duration were within 30 min of the natural ABL. Plain Language Summary Wind farms and single wind turbines change low-level atmospheric transport of momentum, heat, and water vapor, increase surface nighttime temperature, and decrease surface humidity. We infer that wind farms and single turbines also modify transitions in warming and cooling of the air during the daytime to nighttime hours. Measurements are used from a twin 120-m tall tower network in Iowa to detect differences in the evening transition between a location outside of a wind farm and near a single turbine or inside the wind farm. Behind a single turbine, the surface air cools 2 hr earlier while the air within the blade swept area cools 1 hr later when compared to outside the wind farm. Wind farm flow causes a small difference (30 min) to the transition. The results provide additional evidence that wind turbines may influence biological regulation of soil microorganisms, plants, or animals in the proximity of wind energy production facilities.

J	Mizoguchi, B; Valenzuela, N				Mizoguchi, Beatriz; Valenzuela, Nicole			Alternative splicing and thermosensitive expression of Dmrt1 during urogenital development in the painted turtle, Chrysemys picta	PEERJ			English	Article						Turtles; Spliceoforms; Chrysemys picta; Dmrt1; Sex determination; Sex differentiation; Transcriptional regulation evolution	DEPENDENT SEX DETERMINATION; EARED SLIDER TURTLE; EARLY GONADAL DEVELOPMENT; APALONE-MUTICA TURTLES; GENE-EXPRESSION; RNA-SEQ; DIMORPHIC EXPRESSION; DOUBLESEX PROTEINS; DIFFERENTIAL GENE; TELEOST FISH	Background. The doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (Dmrt1) is a highly conserved gene across numerous vertebrates and invertebrates in sequence and function. Small aminoacid changes in Dmrt1 are associated with turnovers in sex determination in reptiles. Dmrt1 is upregulated in males during gonadal development in many species, including the painted turtle, Chrysemys pieta, a reptile with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Dmrt1 is reported to play different roles during sex determination and differentiation, yet whether these functions are controlled by distinct Dmrt1 spliceoforms remains unclear. While Dmrt1 isoforms have been characterized in various vertebrates, no study has investigated their existence in any turtle. Methods. We examine the painted turtle to identify novel Dmrt1 isoforms that may be present during urogenital development using PCR, profile their expression by RNA-seq across five embryonic stages at male- and female-producing temperatures, and validate their expression pattern via qPCR with transcript-specific fluorescent probes. Results. A novel Dmrt1 spliceoform was discovered for the first time in chelonians, lacking exons 2 and 3 (Dmrt1 Delta Ex2Ex3). Dmrt1 canonical and Delta Ex2Ex3 transcripts were differentialy expressed by temperature at stages 19 and 22 in developing gonads of painted turtles, after the onset of sex determination, and displayed a significant male-biased expression pattern. This transcriptional pattern differs from studies in other turtles and vertebrates that reported Dmrt1 differential expression before or at the onset of sex determination. This study provides the first insight into Dmrt1 transcriptional diversity in turtles and opens the door for future functional studies of the alternative Dmrt1 transcript uncovered here. Conclusions. The discovery of an isoform in turtles indicate that alternative splicing may be a common feature of Dmrt1 across vertebrates, as isoforms are also found in crocodilians, birds, mammals and fish, and this variation remains unexplained. The relatively late-onset of Dmrt1 expression observed here contrasts with other turtles, indicating that Dmrt1 is not the topmost male sex -determining factor in C. pieta. When placed in a phylogenetic context, this discrepancy underscores the divergent regulation of Dmrt1, and of sexual development more generally, across vertebrates.

Traditionally, DH production requires the use of chemical doubling agents to induce haploid genome doubling and, subsequently, male fertility. These chemicals can be harmful to humans and the plants themselves, and typically result in a doubling rate of 10%-30%. Spontaneous genome doubling and male fertility of maize haploids, without using chemical doubling agents, have been observed to a limited extent, for nearly 70 years. Rates of spontaneous haploid genome doubling (SHGD) have ranged from less than 5% to greater than 50%. Recently, there has been increased interest to forgo chemical treatment and instead utilize this natural method of doubling. Genetic-mapping studies comprising worldwide germplasm have been conducted. Of particular interest has been the detection of large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting SHGD. Having a single large-effect QTL with an additive nature provides flexibility for the method of introgression, such as marker-assisted backcrossing, marker-assisted gene pyramiding, and systematic design. Moreover, it allows implementation of new methodologies, such as haploid-inducer mediated genome editing (HI-edit) and promotion of alleles by genome editing. We believe the use of SHGD can further enhance the impact of DH technology in maize.

Their importance to the industry has made them targets for metabolic engineering to improve relevant phenotypes and several methods of genome engineering in these organisms have been established. While the efficiency of these techniques is variable, in recent years the ability to select for successful recombinants has markedly increased the throughput of genome engineering. This review summarizes recent advances in genome engineering in lactic acid bacteria and applications that will be enabled by high-throughput techniques.

They often have limited computational capacity ruling out many of the traditional heavy-duty software countermeasures. In this work, we deploy hardware/software solutions to detect CFI attacks. Some of the medium capability IoT devices, for example based on Raspberry Pi, contain ARM Cortex A-53 (Pi 3) or Cortex A-73 (Pi 4) processors. These processors include hardware counters to count microarchitecture level events affecting performance. Lighter weight IoT devices, say based on ARM Cortex M4 or M7, include DWT (Debug, Watch & Trace) module. When control flow anomalies caused by attacks such as buffer overflow or return oriented programming (ROP) occur, they leave a microarchitectural footprint. Hardware counters reflect such footprints to flag control flow anomalies. This paper is geared towards buffer overflow and ROP control flow anomaly detection in embedded programs. The targeted program entities are main event loops and task/event handlers. The proposed anomaly detection mechanism is evaluated on ArduPilot [1] - a popular autopilot software on a Raspberry Pi 3 with PMU and DWT. A self-navigation program is evaluated on an iCreate Roomba platform with an ARM Cortex M4 processor with DWT only. We are able to achieve 97-99%+ accuracy with 1-10 micro-second time overhead per control flow anomaly check.

Repairing software that uses DNNs is one such unmistakable SE need where automated tools could be beneficial; however, we do not fully understand challenges to repairing and patterns that are utilized when manually repairing DNNs. What challenges should automated repair tools address? What are the repair patterns whose automation could help developers? Which repair patterns should be assigned a higher priority for building automated bug repair tools? This work presents a comprehensive study of bug fix patterns to address these questions. We have studied 415 repairs from Stack Overflow and 555 repairs from GitHub for five popular deep learning libraries Caffe, Keras, Tensorflow, Theano, and Torch to understand challenges in repairs and bug repair patterns. Our key findings reveal that DNN bug fix patterns are distinctive compared to traditional bug fix patterns; the most common bug fix patterns are fixing data dimension and neural network connectivity; DNN bug fixes have the potential to introduce adversarial vulnerabilities; DNN bug fixes frequently introduce new bugs; and DNN bug localization, reuse of trained model, and coping with frequent releases are major challenges faced by developers when fixing bugs. We also contribute a benchmark of 667 DNN (bug, repair) instances.

The transmitter hides the covert (private) message by superimposing it onto a non-covert (public) message such that the total transmission power remains the same whether or not the covert message is transmitted. It makes the detection of the covert message impossible unless the non-covert message is decoded. We exploit the multiplicity of non-covert messages (users) to provide a degree of freedom in choosing the non-covert message such that the total detection error probability (sum of the probability of false alalrm and missed detection) is maximized. We also exploit the channel variation to minimize the throughput loss on the non-covert message by sending the covert message only when the transmission rate of the non-covert message is low. We show that the total detection error probability converges fast to 1 as the number of non-covert users increases and that the total detection error probability increases as the transmit power increases, without requiring a pre-shared secret among the nodes.

The experimental study was carried out by leveraging the unique Icing Research Tunnel of Iowa State University (i.e., ISU-IRT) to generate typical wet glaze and dry rime icing conditions experienced by power transmission cables. A cylindrical power cable model, which has the same diameter as that of typical power transmission cables, was mounted in ISU-IRT for the ice accretion experiments. In addition to using a high-speed digital imaging system to record the dynamic ice accretion process, a novel digital image projection (DIP) based technique was utilized to quantify the 3D shapes of the ice structures accreted on the surface of the power cable model as a function of the ice accretion time. The time variations of the aerodynamic drag force acting on the test model during the dynamic ice accretion process were also measured quantitatively by using high-sensitive force/moment traducers mounted at two ends of the test model. The ice structures accreted over the surface of the power cable model were found to change significantly under different icing conditions (i.e., rime icing vs. glaze icing). The characteristics of the aerodynamic drag acting on the test model was found to vary significantly during the dynamic ice accretion process depending on what types of ice structures were accreted on the test model. The acquired snapshots of the ice accretion images and the measured 3D shapes of the accreted ice structures on the test model are correlated with the aerodynamic force measurement results to elucidate the underlying physics.

Consequently CAN and ECUs are high priority targets for hackers. As CAN implementation details are held as proprietary information by vehicle manufacturers, it can be challenging to decode and correlate CAN messages to specific vehicle operations. To understand the precise meanings of CAN messages, reverse engineering techniques that are time-consuming, manually intensive, and require a physical vehicle are typically used. This work aims to address the process of reverse engineering CAN messages for their functionality by creating a machine learning classifier that analyzes messages and determines their relationship to other messages and vehicular functions.

Numerical analysis approaches use laboratory mixture data to predict field performance. This study compares predicted rutting by MEPDG design, estimated rutting from Finite Element (FE) simulations, and actual rutting performance in the field. Ten years ago, warm mix asphalt research was underway to measure the effect of warm mix asphalt (WMA) additives and lower production temperatures on performance. WMA benefits include reduced mixing/compaction temperatures, reduced fuel consumption, and improved compatibility. In 2009, three asphalt overlay projects were constructed in Iowa using both hot mix asphalt (HMA), and WMA mixes to compare their performance. A series of dynamic modulus tests were conducted to determine dynamic modulus and phase angles of HMA and WMA mixtures. The dynamic modulus results were used to develop FE viscoelastic simulations to predict the rutting of HMA/WMA pavement sections. Iowa's pavement management system provided field rutting of WMA/HMA sections. Also, pavement sections were evaluated using mixture input parameters in the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG). The results showed MEPDG based on linear elastic theories might overestimate the rutting of asphalt pavements, especially overlays placed on Jointed Plain Concrete Pavement (JPCP). In contrast, the FEM based on viscoelastic theories more accurately predicted the rutting of pavements. Calibration coefficients are proposed by this study, which may be useful for design engineers and industrial applications to correct and modify MEPDG overlay design thicknesses for HMA/WMA mixes placed on HMA and JPCP surfaces.

Oxidation kinetics of biochar from woody and herbaceous biomass	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Kinetics; Biochar; Autothermal; Fluidized bed; Attrition; Thermogravimetric analyzer	FAST PYROLYSIS; FLUIDIZED-BED; COMBUSTION CHARACTERISTICS; CHAR COMBUSTION; GASIFICATION; ALKALI; COAL; REACTIVITY; PARTICLES; ATTRITION	The goal of this study was to determine oxidation kinetics for biochar produced from fast pyrolysis of various biomass feedstocks. In particular, the role of inherent ash content on the oxidation rate was evaluated. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and fluidized bed combustion experiments were used to explore oxidation kinetics of six fast pyrolysis produced biochars with diverse ash content. Reaction rates varied by a factor of three under chemical kinetic-limited conditions, demonstrating inorganic content impacts oxidation rate. Chemical kinetic rate coefficients were proposed as a function of compositional parameters to determine overall fit and impact. Potassium content was found to have a positive correlation, best describing the differences in the oxidation kinetic rate coefficients. Additionally, feedstocks were subjected to a 1 M HCl acid wash mitigating the catalytic activity of the metals. Acid washed biochars had lower oxidation kinetic rates compared to their unwashed counterparts, indicating the removal of catalytically active metals reduced oxidation rate. Gas composition (CO/CO2) was measured during fluidized bed experiments for both acid-washed and unwashed biochars, which varied between the six biochars. Formation of CO2 was greatly affected by catalytic metals, finding potassium content to correlate well with a higher percentage of CO2 formation as compared to CO. Comparison of oxidation rates were made between the two experimental apparatuses to measure the effect of attrition on biochar oxidation.

In the past four decades, significant efforts have been dedicated to cell adhesive force detection, visualization and quantification. A recent important methodological advancement in cell adhesive force visualization is to adopt force-to-fluorescence conversion instead of force-to-substrate strain conversion, thus greatly improving the sensitivity and resolution of force imaging. This review summarizes the recent development of force imaging techniques (collectively termed as cell adhesive force microscopy or CAFM here), with a particular focus on the improvement of CAFM's spatial resolution and the biomaterial choices for constructing the tension sensors used in force visualization. This review also highlights the importance of DNA-based tension sensors in cell adhesive force imaging and the recent breakthrough in the development of super-resolution CAFM.

As part of a comprehensive effort to actualize services, CSRU and university partners developed and evaluated a positive family support model to maintain relationships with non-custodial parents. This article describes the evolution of the programming and examines the association between targeted child support enforcement initiative (termed Projecting Positivity Promotes Positivity and Cultural Change or Px4C2) and non-custodial parents' support payments. We use the difference-indifferences framework to estimate the intervention effects on non-custodial parents' child support. Results from the program evaluation model and payment data suggest a positive association with increased child support payments by 25 dollars on average and a 6.1 percentage point increase in the ratios of child support payments to child support dues. Results suggest that while this new approach was associated with increases for all noncustodial parents, the association was stronger for those who did not have a formal child support enforcement measure or mechanism in place prior to the intervention.

These disadvantages limit the applicability of conventional cell lysis and DNA extraction methods in high-throughput applications, particularly in forensics and clinical laboratories. To overcome these drawbacks, a series of nine hydrophobic magnetic ionic liquids (MILs) previously shown to preconcentrate DNA were explored as cell lysis reagents. The MILs were found to lyse white blood cells from whole blood, 2-fold diluted blood, and dry blood samples while simultaneously extracting human genomic DNA. The identity of metal ion incorporated within the MIL appears to cause hemolysis while the cationic component further reduces the cell's integrity. Over 500 pg of human genomic DNA was isolated from 50 mu L of whole blood using the trioctylbenzylammonium tris(hexafluoroacetylaceto)nickelate(II) ([N-8,8,8,Bz(+)][Ni(hfacac)(3)(-)]) MIL, and 800 pg DNA was isolated from a dry blood samples using the trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium tris(phenyltrifluoroacetylaceto)nickelate(II) ([P-6,6,6,14(+)][Ni(Phfacac)(3)(-)]) MIL following a 1-min vortex step. A rapid, one-step cell lysis and DNA extraction from blood is ideal for settings that seek high-throughput analysis while minimizing the potential for contamination.

Their proposed functions include sponging of microRNAs (miRNAs), sequestration and trafficking of proteins, assembly of multimeric complexes, production of peptides, and regulation of transcription. Backsplicing due to RNA structures formed by an exceptionally high number of Alu repeats lead to the production of a vast repertoire of circRNAs by human Survival Motor Neuron genes, SMN1 and SMN2, that code for SMN, an essential multi-functional protein. Low levels of SMN due to deletion or mutation of SMN1 result in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a major genetic disease of infants and children. Mild SMA is also recorded in adult population, expanding the spectrum of the disease. Here we review SMN circRNAs with respect to their biogenesis, sequence features, and potential functions. We also discuss how SMN circRNAs could be exploited for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

The therapeutic paste was prepared by combining various doses of theophylline (0, 75, 100, and 125 mg) with different concentrations of methylcellulose (MC) A4M (8, 10, and 12%). The paste was then 3D printed into semisolid tablets under optimized printing conditions. The rheological properties of printing pastes were related to the 3D printability. Our results indicated that to be 3D printed using the current platform, the storage modulus (G ') of the printing paste should be higher than the loss modulus (G '') during the frequency sweep (0.1-600 rad/s), and the tan delta should fall in the range of 0.25-0.27 at 0.63 rad/s. The printed tablets formulated with 10% MC showed the highest overall quality, considering the aspects of resolution, texture, and shape retention regardless of the dosage. The scanning electron microscopy images indicated that the cross-linked structure of MC A4M formed the microscale porous microstructure, which has the potential to embed the theophylline, thus delayed the release through the barrier effect. The in vitro dissolution test revealed that the 3D printed tablets exhibited a sustained release during the first 12 hr. The findings in this study will support the development of customized, personalized medicine with improved efficacy.

Modeling disease distribution over time can provide insight into the development of more efficient regional surveillance approaches. Herein we propose a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to describe the distribution of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in Iowa USA. Model parameters are estimated through a Bayesian spatio-temporal model approach which can account for missing values. For illustration, we apply the proposed model to PEDV test results from the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU-VDL). A simulation study carried out to evaluate the model showed that the proposed model captured the pattern of PEDV distribution and its spatio-temporal dependence.

An online experiment study was conducted to investigate the interaction effects between regulatory focus (prevention- or promotion-focus) and reference points (self- or other-referencing) on consumers' perceived intrinsic motives of event organizations' green activities, their attitude toward the company's FWR practices, and their behavioral intention toward participating in the company's FWR practices as well as mediating effect of perceived intrinsic motives. Findings revealed a significant interaction effect between regulatory focus and reference points on persuasiveness of green appeals in the context of FWR practices. Mediation analysis revealed that the impact of regulatory focus message on behavioral intention is serially mediated via perceived intrinsic motives and attitude and this serial mediation effects vary in different reference points. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of ocular parameters in humans and selected animals, with a focus on the ocular surface, detailing species differences in ocular surface anatomy, physiology, tear film dynamics and tear film composition. We describe major pitfalls that tremendously limit the translational potential of traditional laboratory animals (i.e., rabbits, mice, and rats) in ophthalmic research, and highlight the benefits of integrating companion dogs with clinical analogues to human diseases into preclinical pharmacology studies. This One Health approach can help accelerate and improve the framework in which ophthalmic research is translated to the human clinic. Studies can be conducted in canine subjects with naturally occurring or noninvasively induced ocular surface disorders (e.g., dry eye disease, conjunctivitis), reviewed herein, and tear fluid can be easily retrieved from canine eyes for various bioanalytical purposes. In this review, we discuss common tear collection methods, including capillary tubes and Schirmer tear strips, and provide guidelines for tear sampling and extraction to improve the reliability of analyte quantification (drugs, proteins, others).

J	Anast, JM; Schmitz-Esser, S				Anast, Justin M.; Schmitz-Esser, Stephan			The transcriptome of Listeria monocytogenes during co-cultivation with cheese rind bacteria suggests adaptation by induction of ethanolamine and 1,2-propanediol catabolism pathway genes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NORB EFFLUX PUMP; STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; FOODBORNE ILLNESS; SECRETION SYSTEM; ACID SHOCK; IN-VITRO; GROWTH; EXPRESSION; VIRULENCE; PROTEINS	The survival of Listeria (L.) monocytogenes in foods and food production environments (FPE) is dependent on several genes that increase tolerance to stressors; this includes competing with intrinsic bacteria. We aimed to uncover genes that are differentially expressed (DE) in L. monocytogenes sequence type (ST) 121 strain 6179 when co-cultured with cheese rind bacteria. L. monocytogenes was cultivated in broth or on plates with either a Psychrobacter or Brevibacterium isolate from cheese rinds. RNA was extracted from co-cultures in broth after two or 12 hours and from plates after 24 and 72 hours. Broth co-cultivations with Brevibacterium or Psychrobacter yielded up to 392 and 601 DE genes, while plate co-cultivations significantly affected the expression of up to 190 and 485 L. monocytogenes genes, respectively. Notably, the transcription of virulence genes encoding the Listeria adhesion protein and Listeriolysin O were induced during plate and broth co-cultivations. The expression of several systems under the control of the global stress gene regulator, sigma(B), increased during co-cultivation. A cobalamin-dependent gene cluster, responsible for the catabolism of ethanolamine and 1,2-propanediol, was upregulated in both broth and plate co-cultures conditions. Finally, a small non-coding (nc)RNA, Rli47, was induced after 72 hours of co-cultivation on plates and accounted for 50-90% of the total reads mapped to L. monocytogenes. A recent study has shown that Rli47 may contribute to L. monocytogenes stress survival by slowing growth during stress conditions through the suppression of branch-chained amino acid biosynthesis. We hypothesize that Rli47 may have an impactful role in the response of L. monocytogenes to co-cultivation by regulating a complex network of metabolic and virulence mechanisms.

Wireless position sensing and normalization of embedded resonant sensors using a resonator array	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL			English	Article						Position sensor; Embedded sensor; Wireless; Radio frequency		In this work, four square, planar resonators with unique frequency windows were used to form a 2 by 2 array for wireless position determination and normalization of position-dependent, embedded resonant sensors. First, a master table of 5 vertical bar 21 vertical bar gain and phase data was collected at 8100 positions. Automated scripts extracted the characteristic gain and phase peaks and used cubic interpolation to expand the master table to 7,157,160 unique angle and coordinate positions. An unknown position is then determined by comparing its S vertical bar 21 vertical bar measurements to this table. To further improve the position accuracy, multiple measurements are collected on linear flyby trajectories. The average and standard deviation of predicted position offset from true value using this method were 3.2 and 2.3 mm, respectively. To test normalization of a position dependent sensor, a spiral resonant sensor was placed underneath the square array. The sensor signal was modulated using varying amounts of water on the sensor surface. A corrected reading was determined using four different flyby trajectories using the position array data to adjust the signal based on position. We found that average errors of the normalized signals were between 0.04 to 0.15 MHz at lower water volume (0.5 mL) and -0.53 to -0.74 MHz at higher water volume (2.0 mL). In its current state, the positional array can be used for asset tracking or feedback control and the sensor normalization can be used to improve the measurement accuracy of embedded sensors. This technique can be further improved by collecting more accurate master calibration data using an automated system. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	O'Neill, KC; Hinners, P; Lee, YJ				O'Neill, Kelly C.; Hinners, Paige; Lee, Young Jin			Potential of triacylglycerol profiles in latent fingerprints to reveal individual diet, exercise, or health information for forensic evidence	ANALYTICAL METHODS			English	Article							IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; LASER-DESORPTION IONIZATION; MATRIX APPLICATION; FATTY-ACIDS; TIME; FINGERMARKS; GENDER	Triacylglycerols (TGs) are a primary component of human skin oils and are therefore a major constituent present in latent fingerprint residue. We hypothesize that differences in the TG profile of the latent fingerprint, such as the relative level of saturation of the fatty acyl chains, may link back to the overall health of the subject, specifically correlated to diabetes. A small scale proof-of-concept study was performed to test this hypothesis. The biggest differences observed were in the relative amounts of completely saturated TGs compared to TGs with one or more double bonds; however, hierarchical clustering could not differentiate diabetic and non-diabetic participants. The role of other factors such as diet and exercise was explored from subsets of the non-diabetic participants. Vegetarian participants had higher relative levels of saturated TGs compared to those without diet restrictions; however, people on a low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet were not distinguishable from the control population. In terms of exercise, male participants who were very active had lower levels of saturated TGs compared to males who did not exercise at all. In contrast, exercise did not have much of an effect on the TG profile of female participants. While the outcome of this study is only tentative due to the lack of statistical power, it suggests the potential of TG profiles to be linked to health information, diet and exercise.

This study, conducted at seven sites in Iowa from 2002 to 2014, included five tillage systems: conservation tillage (no tillage [NT], strip-tillage [ST]) and CT (chisel plow [CP], deep rip [DR], and moldboard plow [MP]) as main treatment and three crop rotations (corn-soybean [C-S], corn-corn-soybean [C-C-S], and continuous corn [C-C]) as subtreatments in a completely randomized block design with four replications. The objective was to quantify the effect of different tillage intensities and crop rotations on SOC change in different regions in Iowa. The average SOC gain in northern Iowa with NT and ST was 0.33 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) over 12 yr with C-S and C-C-S and 0.28 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) over 7 yr in the C-C rotations. The average SOC loss with CP, DR, and MP was -0.34 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) with C-S and C-C-S and -0.36 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) with C-C over the same periods. In southern Iowa, NT and ST gained 0.36 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) with C-S and C-C-S and 0.33 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) with C-C, whereas CP, DR, and MP on average lost -0.36 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) with C-S and C-C-S and -0.34 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) with C-C. The findings also showed that most SOC change (gain or loss) occurred at the top 0-30 cm with no evidence of significant SOC translocation to lower depths.

The produced graphene ink is tailored for printable and flexible electronics, having shown promising results in terms of electrical conductivity and temporal stability. Shear force generated by steel balls which resulted in 2-3 layer defect-free graphene platelets with an average size of hundreds of nm, and with a concentration of about 5.1 mg/mL characterized by Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmittance electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-vis spectroscopy. Further, a conductive ink was prepared and printed on flexible substrate (Polyimide) with controlled resolution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Profilometry revealed the effect of thermal annealing on the prints to concede consistent morphological characteristics. The resulted sheet resistance was measured to be Rs = 36.75 omega/sqr for prints as long as 100 mm.

The engineering properties of calcareous sands differ from those of clays and silica sands due to the high particle angularity and in situ void ratios. Investigation of calcareous sands properties and stress-strain response are required for the design and long-term maintenance of offshore infrastructure including piers, bridges, and offshore renewable energy structures. In this research, calcareous sands from Puerto Rico are investigated to determine the monotonic stress-strain response and how increasing severities of particle damage and crushing affect loading behavior. To accomplish this, several advanced laboratory tests were conducted: 1) triaxial tests (CU) were utilized to investigate the monotonic stress-strain behavior; 2) oedometer tests, providing the one-directional compression load for sand crushing. The calcareous specimens were tested under various confining pressures (sigma(3)) and with increasing percentages of crushed material.

The integration of biological and chemical processes, which harnesses the strength of each type of process, can lead to advantaged processes over processes limited to one or the other. This synergy can be achieved through bioprivileged molecules that can be leveraged to produce a diversity of products, including both replacement molecules and novel molecules with enhanced performance properties. However, important challenges arise in the development of bioprivileged molecules.

C	Khoshmanesh, S; Lutz, R			IEEE	Khoshmanesh, Seyedehzahra; Lutz, Robyn			Does Link Prediction Help Find Feature Interactions in Software Product Lines?	2020 IEEE SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING (AIRE 2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Requirements Engineering (AIRE)	SEP 01, 2020	Zurich, SWITZERLAND	IEEE Comp Soc				An ongoing challenge for the requirements engineering of software product lines is to predict whether a new combination of features (units of functionality) will create an unwanted or even hazardous feature interaction. We thus seek to improve and automate the prediction of unwanted feature interactions early in development. In this paper we show how the detection of unwanted feature interactions in a software product line can be effectively represented as a link prediction problem. Link prediction uses machine learning algorithms and similarity scores among a graph's nodes to identify likely new edges. We here model the product line features as nodes and the unwanted interactions among the features as edges. We investigate six link-based similarity metrics, some using local and some using global knowledge of the graph, for use in this context. We evaluate our approach on a software product line benchmark in the literature, building six machine-learning models from the graph-based similarity data. Results show that the best ML algorithms achieved accuracy of 0.75 to 1 for classifying feature interactions as unwanted or wanted in this small study, and that global similarity metrics performed better than local similarity metrics here. The work shows how link-prediction models can help find missing edges, which represent unwanted feature interactions that are undocumented or unrecognized, earlier in development.

Semisymmetrization and Mendelsohn quasigroups	COMMENTATIONES MATHEMATICAE UNIVERSITATIS CAROLINAE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Loops	JUL 07-13, 2019	Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Budapest, HUNGARY	Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Algebra Dept, Univ Szeged, Bolyai Inst	Budapest Univ Technol & Econ	semisymmetric; quasigroup; Mendelsohn triple system		The semisymmetrization of an arbitrary quasigroup builds a semisymmetric quasigroup structure on the cube of the underlying set of the quasigroup. It serves to reduce homotopies to homomorphisms. An alternative semisymmetrization on the square of the underlying set was recently introduced by A. Krape.z and Z. Petric. Their construction in fact yields a Mendelsohn quasigroup, which is idempotent as well as semisymmetric. We describe it as the Mendelsohnization of the original quasigroup. For quasigroups isotopic to an abelian group, the relation between the semisymmetrization and the Mendelsohnization is studied. It is shown that the semisymmetrization is the total space for an action of the Mendelsohnization on the abelian group. The Mendelsohnization of an abelian group isotope is then identified as the idempotent replica of its semisymmetrization, with fibers isomorphic to the abelian group.	[Smith, Jonathan D.

J	Xie, SW; Ren, J				Xie, Shengwen; Ren, Juan			Linearization of Recurrent-Neural-Network- Based Models for Predictive Control of Nano-Positioning Systems Using Data-Driven Koopman Operators	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Computational modeling; Predictive models; Nonlinear dynamical systems; Predictive control; Recurrent neural networks; Taylor series; Recurrent neural network; predictive control; Koopman operator; linearization	SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; DYNAMICAL-SYSTEMS; DECOMPOSITION	Recent studies have shown that the nonlinear dynamics of nano-positioning systems (e.g., piezo-electric actuators (PEAs)) can be accurately captured by recurrent neural networks (RNNs). One direct application of this technique is PEA system control for precision positioning: linearize the nonlinear RNN model and then apply model predictive control (MPC). However, due to the linearization approach commonly used (e.g., Taylor series), the control bandwidth and the control performance are quite limited as the obtained linear system is only guaranteed to be accurate within small neighborhood of the linearization point. To address this issue, we propose a Koopman operator-based approach for linearization and then use the obtained linear parameter-varying model for predictive control. This linearization scheme can significantly decrease the overall approximation error within the MPC prediction horizon, and thus, lead to improved tracking performance. The proposed approach was validated through two applications-trajectory tracking of PEA, and deformation control of polymers during atomic force microscope nano-indentation.

J	Hayden, HE; Prince, AMT				Hayden, H. Emily; Prince, Angela M. T.			Disrupting ableism: Strengths-based representations of disability in children's picture books	JOURNAL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD LITERACY			English	Article; Early Access						Early literacy instruction; critical literacy events; identity; literacy practices; picture books; democratic practices; story book interactions; shared reading; disability; content analysis		Children's literature is a powerful influence on the social construction of perceptions and narratives, and it is critically important that all children see themselves represented in the books in their classrooms. However, strength-based views of characters with a disability are rare in children's picture books, meaning that children with a disability may not see themselves reflected in the books on their classroom shelves. Even worse, books may reinforce limiting, ableist stereotypes and myths about people with disabilities and their lives. Representing characters with disabilities in strength-based ways in children's literature, where "the person's own abilities and strengths are explicitly considered [and] empowerment of the person has a high priority", could educate able-bodied students about disability, promote attitudes of acceptance and strengthen perceptions of self-worth among students with disabilities as well as their typically-developing peers. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of 34 exemplar picture books featuring a main character with a disability. Low occurrence disabilities such as visual impairment were more frequently represented than high incidence disabilities such as a specific learning disability, but the main characters in our highest rated books modelled self-awareness, agency and acceptance. These books disrupted ableist myths about disability and provided the reader with tools to push back against both implicit and explicit stereotyping, teasing and bullying. By incorporating children's picture books with strength-based representations of disability into research and teaching for primary classroom literacy instruction, we can reinforce valuable social emotional skills that foreground respect for the humanity and dignity of all students.

To comply with these safety measures, several changes to the English Placement Test of Oral Communication (EPT OC) had to be made. This paper discusses how the EPT OC was adapted to comply with the safety regulations mandated by the university administration and best ensure the safety of students and raters. It also describes the different considerations that were made prior to implementing these adaptations, and our thoughts while administering and rating the test. The paper concludes with what might be learned from administering the OC test during the pandemic.

Along with the industrial acceptance of ESS, research on storage technologies and their grid applications is also undergoing rapid progress. We present an overview of ESS including different storage technologies, various grid applications, cost-benefit analysis, and market policies. First, we classify storage technologies with grid application potential into several groups according to the form of energy stored. This classification is presented to summarize technological and economic characteristics of storage technologies and also present the recent development of these technologies. Next, we categorize the grid applications of ESS into several groups based on the physical location, service type, and working principle. We also review the state-of-the-art optimization and control methodologies for each application group. Furthermore, we present the cost-benefit analysis for three types of investors and a comprehensive comparison among market policies for the participation of ESS in different wholesale markets. Finally, we highlight several future research directions that are derived from this review. To improve the performance and profitability of ESS for electric grid applications, future research should have a focus on developing decision making tools for determining the storage technology, installed capacity, and operating strategy. This research focus should be supported by the further developments of component-level performance and aging models, system-level market frameworks, and cost-benefit analysis.

J	Subramaniam, S				Subramaniam, Shankar			Multiphase flows: Rich physics, challenging theory, and big simulations	PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS			English	Article								Understanding multiphase flows is vital to addressing some of our most pressing human needs: clean air, clean water, and the sustainable production of food and energy. This article focuses on a subset of multiphase flows called particle-laden suspensions involving nondeforming particles in a carrier fluid. The hydrodynamic interactions in these flows result in rich multiscale physics, such as clustering and pseudo-turbulence, with important practical implications. Theoretical formulations to represent, explain, and predict these phenomena encounter peculiar challenges that multiphase flows pose for classical statistical mechanics. A critical analysis of existing approaches leads to the identification of key desirable characteristics that a formulation must possess in order to be successful at representing these physical phenomena. The need to build accurate closure models for unclosed terms that arise in statistical theories has motivated the development of particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR-DNS) for model-free simulation at the microscale. A critical perspective on outstanding questions and potential limitations of PR-DNS for model development is provided. Selected highlights of recent progress using PR-DNS to discover new multiphase flow physics and develop models are reviewed. Alternative theoretical formulations and extensions to current formulations are outlined as promising future research directions. The article concludes with a summary perspective on the importance of integrating theoretical, modeling, computational, and experimental efforts at different scales.

The Transcription Factor bZIP60 Links the Unfolded Protein Response to the Heat Stress Response in Maize([OPEN])	PLANT CELL			English	Article							ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS; AUTOPHAGY CONTRIBUTES; SHOCK PROTEINS; ARABIDOPSIS; MAIZE; DEGRADATION; TEMPERATURE; ACTIVATION; NETWORK; SYSTEM	The transcription factor bZIP60 links a system that alerts plants to problems in protein folding to a system that protects plants from heat stress. The unfolded protein response (UPR) and the heat shock response (HSR) are two evolutionarily conserved systems that protect plants from heat stress. The UPR and HSR occur in different cellular compartments and both responses are elicited by misfolded proteins that accumulate under adverse environmental conditions such as heat stress. While the UPR and HSR appear to operate independently, we have found a link between them in maize (Zea mays) involving the production of the BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER60 (bZIP60) transcription factor, a pivotal response of the UPR to heat stress. Surprisingly, a mutant (bzip60-2) knocking down bZIP60 expression blunted the HSR at elevated temperatures and prevented the normal upregulation of a group of heat shock protein genes in response to elevated temperature. The expression of a key HEAT SHOCK FACTOR TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR13 (HSFTF13, a HEAT SHOCK FACTOR A6B [HSFA6B] family member) was compromised in bzip60-2, and the HSFTF13 promoter was shown to be a target of bZIP60 in maize protoplasts. In addition, the upregulation by heat of genes involved in chlorophyll catabolism and chloroplast protein turnover were subdued in bzip60-2, and these genes were also found to be targets of bZIP60. Thus, the UPR, an endoplasmic-reticulum-associated response, quite unexpectedly contributes to the nuclear/cytoplasmic HSR in maize.

Marked hypercalcemia developed within a short span of time, raising clinical concerns for neoplasia. Diagnostic imaging and fine-needle aspirate cytology were consistent with pancreatitis. Marked elevation in parathyroid hormone-related protein with low parathyroid hormone further supported the diagnosis of underlying neoplasia. The dog's clinical status declined despite aggressive medical supportive therapy. Humane euthanasia was elected. Postmortem examination revealed an extensive pancreatic neoplasm confirmed as exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinoma with diffuse intra-abdominal metastases. Acute kidney injury most likely resulted from the severe pancreatic inflammation (pancreatitis) and hypercalcemia of malignancy caused by the exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This is the first reported case of hypercalcemia of malignancy associated with exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinoma in a dog.	[Johannes, Chad M.; Heinrich, Ellen R.

Latent Profile Analysis of Traditional and Cyber-Aggression and Victimization: Associations with Dark Triad Traits and Psychopathology Symptoms	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Aggression; Victimization; Cyber-aggression; Dark triad; CU traits	CALLOUS-UNEMOTIONAL TRAITS; RELATIONAL AGGRESSION; EMOTION REGULATION; INTERNALIZING SYMPTOMS; REACTIVE AGGRESSION; EMERGING ADULTHOOD; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; VICTIMS; PEER; BULLIES	Research has shown that while traditional (e.g., physical and relational) and cyber aggression and victimization often co-occur, individuals may differ in terms of their experiences with aggression and victimization as well as social-psychological adjustment. The current study investigated whether there are distinct groups of college students who experience different forms of aggression and victimization using latent profile analysis (LPA), and whether these groups differ from one another in their maladaptive personality characteristics and psychopathology symptoms. Participants were 540 undergraduate students from a Midwestern university (53% female; 78.5% White; average age = 19.27 years). Four profiles were identified: Non-Involved (80.7%), Traditional Victim-Only (10.3%), Traditional Aggressor/Victim (4.8%), and Combined Aggressor/Victim (traditional aggression, cyber aggression and victimization; 4.1%). Maladaptive personality traits and psychopathology symptoms differed across the four groups. Both the traditional aggressor/victim group and the combined aggressor/victim group, compared to the non-involved and traditional victim-only group, reported higher levels of narcissism, psychopathy, and callous-unemotional (CU) traits. The traditional aggressor/victim group, compared to the combined aggressor/victim group, reported higher levels of narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and CU traits. The combined aggressor/victim group reported higher levels of psychopathology symptoms (i.e., emotion dysregulation, depression, anxiety, and stress) compared to the traditional aggressor/victim group. These findings enhance our understanding of the heterogeneity in experiences with aggression and victimization among college students, and highlight the importance of developing interventions that target their specific mental health needs.

Yet, complex interactions of a multitude of variables pose formidable challenges to data-driven research. We embarked upon developing an advanced statistical learning and prediction framework with the generalized additive model (GAM). We showed promising performance of GAM with applications to existing RC shear wall databases. Without any prejudice, GAM can predict structural responses accurately using raw databases, and also can identify salient attributes. This study addresses computational implementation and parallel processing, and all codes are made publicly available to promote data-driven research of earthquake engineering community.

Alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms of the same gene may sometimes have very similar sequence, but they can have significantly diverse effects on cellular function and regulation. The products of alternative splicing have important and diverse functional roles, such as response to environmental stress, regulation of gene expression, human heritable, and plant diseases. The mRNA isoforms of the same gene can have dramatically different functions. Despite the functional importance of mRNA isoforms, very little has been done to annotate their functions. The recent years have however seen the development of several computational methods aimed at predicting mRNA isoform level biological functions. These methods use a wide array of proteo-genomic data to develop machine learning-based mRNA isoform function prediction tools. In this review, we discuss the computational methods developed for predicting the biological function at the individual mRNA isoform level.

A lignin -first strategy to recover hydroxycinnamic acids and improve cellulosic ethanol production from corn stover	BIOMASS & BIOENERGY			English	Article						Biorefinery; Cellulosic ethanol; Lignin; Delignification; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Hydroxycinnamic acids	DILUTE SULFURIC-ACID; FERULIC ACID; ENZYMATIC-HYDROLYSIS; CONVERSION; LIQUIDS; WHEAT	The goal of this research is to develop a partial delignification process for corn stover that simultaneously improves accessibility of enzymes to cellulose and recovers hydroxycinnamic acids (HCA) as a value-added product from the lignin. We recover HCAs from corn stover with a mild base extraction employing sodium hydroxide, ethanol, and water. The total HCA yield was 33.5 wt% on a lignin basis and approximately 6 wt% on a corn stover basis. This partial delignification pretreatment allowed 85 wt% of total available glucose to be recovered by enzymatic hydrolysis using an enzyme loading that is only 10% of the level recommended for recovering sugars from lignocellulosic biomass. Technoeconomic analysis indicates that recovery of HCAs could reduce the selling price of ethanol by $0.26 L-1. That part of the lignin not removed as HCA becomes a co-product of enzymatic hydrolysis suitable for thermochemical processing into additional biofuels and/or chemicals.

Control of translation during the unfolded protein response in maize seedlings: Life without PERKs	PLANT DIRECT			English	Article						ER stress; protein synthesis; ribosome profiling; ribosome-protected fragments; stress granules; translation efficiency	ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; GENE-EXPRESSION; PROCESSING BODIES; MESSENGER-RNAS; IN-VIVO; GRANULES; ARABIDOPSIS; PHOSPHORYLATION; ACCUMULATION	The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) defines a condition called ER stress that induces the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR in mammalian cells attenuates protein synthesis initiation, which prevents the piling up of misfolded proteins in the ER. Mammalian cells rely on Protein Kinase RNA-Like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK) phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha to arrest protein synthesis, however, plants do not have a PERK homolog, so the question is whether plants control translation in response to ER stress. We compared changes in RNA levels in the transcriptome to the RNA levels protected by ribosomes and found a decline in translation efficiency, including many UPR genes, in response to ER stress. The decline in translation efficiency is due to the fact that many mRNAs are not loaded onto polyribosomes (polysomes) in proportion to their increase in total RNA, instead some of the transcripts accumulate in stress granules (SGs). The RNAs that populate SGs are not derived from the disassembly of polysomes because protein synthesis remains steady during stress. Thus, the surge in transcription of UPR genes in response to ER stress is accompanied by the formation of SGs, and the sequestration of mRNAs in SGs may serve to temporarily relieve the translation load during ER stress.

Despite the valuable records of nightscape from DMSP (1992-2013) and VIIRS (2012-2018), the potential of the historical archive of NTL observations has not been fully explored because of the severe inconsistency between DMSP and VIIRS. In this study, we generated an integrated and consistent NTL dataset at the global scale by harmonizing the inter-calibrated NTL observations from the DMSP data and the simulated DMSP-like NTL observations from the VIIRS data. The generated global DMSP NTL time-series data (1992-2018) show consistent temporal trends. This temporally extended DMSP NTL dataset provides valuable support for various studies related to human activities such as electricity consumption and urban extent dynamics.

Presently, most studies focused on the improvement of spatial representation in the modeling, with limited efforts for considering the temporal context of urban sprawl. In this paper, we developed a Logistic-Trend-CA model by proposing a trend-adjusted neighborhood as a weighting factor using the information of historical urban sprawl and integrating this factor in the commonly used Logistic-CA model. We applied the developed model in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China and analyzed the model performance to the start year, the suitability surface, and the neighborhood size.ResultsOur results indicate the proposed Logistic-Trend-CA model outperforms the traditional Logistic-CA model significantly, resulting in about 18% and 14% improvements in modeling urban sprawl at medium (1km) and fine (30m) resolutions, respectively. The proposed Logistic-Trend-CA model is more suitable for urban sprawl modeling over a long temporal interval than the traditional Logistic-CA model. In addition, this new model is not sensitive to the suitability surface calibrated from different periods and spaces, and its performance decreases with the increase of the neighborhood size.ConclusionThe proposed model shows potential for modeling future urban sprawl spanning a long period at regional and global scales.

These inducers have the inherent ability of generating seeds with haploid embryos when used to pollinate other genotypes. The resulting haploid plants are treated with a doubling agent and self-pollinated, producing completely homozygous seeds. This rapid method of inbred line production reduces the length of breeding cycles and, consequently, increases genetic gain. Such advantages explain the wide adoption of this technique by large, well-established maize breeding programs. However, a slower rate of adoption was observed in medium to small-scale breeding programs. The high price and/or lack of environmental adaptation of inducers available for licensing, or the poor performance of those free of cost, might explain why smaller operations did not take full advantage of this technique. The lack of adapted inducers is especially felt in tropical countries, where inducer breeding efforts are more recent. Therefore, defining optimal breeding approaches for inducer development could benefit many breeding programs which are in the process of adopting the DH technique. In this manuscript, we review traits important to maize maternal haploid inducers, explain their genetic basis, listing known genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL), and discuss different breeding approaches for inducer development. The performance of haploid inducers has an important impact on the cost of DH line production.

Glass formation and structure of melt quenched mixed oxy-sulfide Na4P2S7-xOx glasses for 0 <= x <= 5	JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS			English	Article						Oxy-Sulfide Glass; Sulfide Glass; SRO Structure; Raman; FT-IR; (31)p MAS NMR	ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; RAMAN; FORMER; CHALLENGES; SPECTRA; ORIGIN; ENERGY; IR; NA	The structures of Na4P2S7-xOx 0 <= x <= 5, glasses were investigated using melt quench (MQ) samples. The short-range order (SRO) structures of these glasses were examined using a combination of Raman, Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR), and P-31 Magic Angle Spinning NMR (P-31 MAS NMR) spectroscopies to determine how oxygen is incorporated into the sulfide structure. Using vibrational spectroscopy, semi-quantitative P-31 MAS NMR, and charge balancing, a complete compositional map of all the SRO structures present in these glasses has been generated. From these results, full incorporation of the oxygen into the sulfide melt was found to occur across the compositional series through a structural disproportionation reaction where oxygen systematically replaces bridging sulfurs (BSs), before replacing the remaining non-bridging sulfurs (NBSs). Under the melting and quenching conditions used in this study, it was found that the melts crystallize too quickly to form homogeneous crystallite-free glasses for x > 5.

Nanostructures synthesized by the galvanic displacement method often lead to non-uniform density and poor size distribution. Here, density and size-controlled synthesis of Au and Cu-based nanostructures was made possible by galvanic displacement with limited exposure to hydrofluoric (HF) acid and the use of surfactants like L-cysteine (L-Cys) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). An approach involving cyclic exposure to HF acid regulated the nanostructure density. Further, the use of surfactants generated monodisperse nanoparticles in the initial stages of the deposition with increased density. The characterization of Au and Cu-based nanostructures was performed by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, UV-Visible spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The surface enhanced Raman spectroscopic measurements demonstrated an increase in the Raman intensity by two to three orders of magnitude for analyte molecules like Rhodamine 6G dye and paraoxon.

College Environment and Basic Psychological Needs: Predicting Academic Major Satisfaction	JOURNAL OF COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						self-determination theory; academic major satisfaction; faculty support; peer support; basic psychological needs	SELF-DETERMINED MOTIVATION; CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSES; STUDENTS; UNIVERSITY; EFFICACY; SUPPORT; BIAS	The authors aimed to extend the literature in self-determination theory (SDT) to understand the relations between college environmental variables (faculty and peer support) and academic major satisfaction. The study was disseminated via an online platform to 320 students attending a large midwestern university. Based on SDT, it was hypothesized that student perceptions of their volitional autonomy. competence, and relatedness in their academic major would fully mediate the relations between perceived faculty and peer supports and major satisfaction. This hypothesized model was tested against a partially mediated model and an alternate model that further tested the directionality of the argument. Results from structural equation modeling partially supported the hypotheses. Faculty and peer support, respectively, significantly contributed to students' experience of volitional autonomy in their major (beta s = .23 and .39), perceived competence in their major (beta s = .31 and .37), and relatedness in their major (beta s = .29 and .56). Volitional autonomy in a major fully mediated the relationship between faculty support and major satisfaction (M = .14, SE = .05, p < .01, 95% confidence interval CI [.04, .24]) and the relationship between peer support and academic major satisfaction (M = .22. SE = .02, p < .05, 95% CI (.10, .341). The hypothesized model was found to be superior than the partially mediated and alternate models. Thus, the authors concluded that SDT is a useful framework for understanding the relationship between faculty and peer supports, psychological needs, and major satisfaction.

Utilizing Branched-chain Amino Acids for Increasing Shoot Density and Establishment Rate in Creeping Bentgrass	HORTTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Agrostis stolonifera; fertilizer; golf; percent cover; turfgrass	PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; TRANSLOCATION	The branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) leucine (L), isoleucine (IL), and valine (V) are synthesized in plants and are essential to growth in most organisms. These compounds can be absorbed by the plant when foliarly applied, but plant catabolism of BCAA is not completely understood. A recent study observed that BCAA applied in a 2:1:1 or 4:1:1 ratio (L:IL:V) increased creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) shoot density compared with applications of equal urea nitrogen (N) at 3.03 lb/acre N. The present study investigated whether those increases could translate to a quicker establishment rate of creeping bentgrass grown from seed in standard greenhouse pots. The BCAA applications were compared with equal N applications using urea and a commercially available amino acid product. All N treatments were applied at 3.03 lb/acre N, per application and applied a total of four times on a 14-day interval starting 14 days after seeding. Measurements included final shoot density counts and root and shoot weights, as well as digital image analysis of percent green cover for each greenhouse pot every 7 days. No differences were observed after 70 days in shoot weight, or percent green cover between BCAA treatments and urea; however, BCAA 2:1:1 and 4:1:1 increased shoot density 21% and 30%, respectively, compared with urea, and were equal to the commercially available amino acid product. Applications of BCAA 4:1:1 also increased creeping bentgrass rooting weight by a factor of 7 compared with urea N.

J	Vanausdall, RA; Dinsmore, SJ				Vanausdall, Rachel A.; Dinsmore, Stephen J.			Detection and density of breeding marsh birds in Iowa wetlands	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AFFECTING DETECTION PROBABILITY; PRAIRIE POTHOLE WETLANDS; RESTORED WETLANDS; HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS; INVERTEBRATE ABUNDANCE; NATURAL WETLANDS; SEDIMENT LOAD; UPPER-MIDWEST; COMMUNITIES; VEGETATION	Accounting for imperfect detection is an important process when obtaining estimates of density or abundance for breeding birds, and this is particularly true when researchers are monitoring birds to assess the success of restored wetlands. Due to the dramatic decline in areal cover and habitat quality, wetland restoration in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) is critically important to breeding birds. The Shallow Lakes Restoration Project (SLRP), a partnership between the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and Ducks Unlimited, Inc., aims to restore degraded shallow lakes throughout the Iowa PPR. We conducted unlimited-radius point counts with call-broadcast surveys for breeding marsh birds at 30 shallow lakes in various stages of restoration in 2016 and 2017. Our goals were to assess the impact of covariates on detection probability and estimate density of these species at non-restored, younger (1-5 years since restoration), and older (6-11 years since restoration) restorations. Detection probability ranged between 0.07 +/- 0.009 (SE) for Red-winged Blackbird and 0.40 +/- 0.09 (SE) for Common Yellowthroat. Percent cattail had a positive quadratic effect on detection probability for four species, with detection decreasing sharply as percent cattail increased and increasing slightly with 100% cattail cover. Wind speed negatively influenced the detection probability of Pied-billed Grebes but had a negative quadratic effect on the detection probability of Marsh Wrens. Both restored shallow lakes had greater densities of breeding Pied-billed Grebes, Marsh Wrens, and Yellow-headed Blackbirds than non-restored shallow lakes, but there was no significant difference between younger and older restorations. Including both habitat and environmental covariates on models for detection probability can improve the precision of estimates for density and should be considered when assessing bird populations pre- and post-restoration of shallow lakes.

One of the methodologies for genetic improvement is biolistic delivery of genetic components into plant cells. In this chapter, we describe steps involved in introducing plasmid DNA carrying gene of interest into rice mature embryos using Biolistic (R) PDS-1000/He particle delivery system. We also provide information required for recovery of transformed plants and production of transgenic seed for next generation analysis. Using this protocol, typical 50-70 putative independent transgenic callus lines can be generated from 100 bombarded embryos. Transgenic rice plantlets can be produced within 2 months after the initiation of seed germination for transformation.

This is partly because simple geometries are easier to work with, but also partly because the tools needed for NDE scientists and engineers to easily work with real geometries have not been available. Modeling and analysis in physical geometric contexts can be more accurate because the geometry can be included in the analysis. In addition, the models naturally align with emerging "digital thread" and "digital twin" concepts for maintaining parallel digital models of entire structures. In this paper we describe an analysis process for pulse (flash) thermography NDE that operates in the physical 3D computer-aided design (CAD) geometry of the underlying part. We also discuss how the thermography problem motivated the development of a new open-source library ("spatialnde2") designed to facilitate the use of 3D CAD geometry in NDE modeling and analysis. Using pulse thermography as an example, we discuss the benefits and challenges of performing data analysis in the 3D CAD domain.

One emerging grid application is using Li-ion BESS in frequency regulation markets for tracking fast-moving frequency regulation signals, such as PJM's RegD signal. However, Li-ion batteries may encounter fast capacity degradation when tracking these signals. To effectively incorporate the cycling-induced degradation cost into the optimal bidding in regulation markets, we develop a statistical feature-based method for capacity degradation estimation. The fractional absolute moment (FAM) of the state-of-charge (SoC) profile is selected as the input feature of a linear regression model that produces an estimate of the capacity degradation as the model's output. Subsequently, the optimal bidding problem is formulated as a convex optimization model to maximize the daily profit of Li-ion BESS in a regulation market. Simulation results show that the proposed model provides, for frequency regulation, cost-effective capacity bidding and 5-min economic basepoints which achieve a tradeoff between regulation credit and battery degradation cost.

SE is a method of estimating the varying state values of voltage magnitude and phase at every bus within a power grid based on meter measurements. This is often done using iterative Newton-type methods. Our proposed PGM-based solver estimates the state values from a different perspective. Specifically, it models the power grid as a PGM, and then assigns potentials to nodes and edges of the PGM, based on the physical constraints of the power grid. This way, the original SE problem is transformed into an equivalent probabilistic inference problem on the PGM, which we show can be solved via Gaussian Belief Propagation. An advantage of using a PGM is that it offers more versatility, as it allows for the direct incorporation of additional context information when estimating state values. We illustrate this method with a simple example and show the practical equivalence between our proposed PGM-based solver and existing SE solvers in terms of state estimates.

Embryonated chicken egg inoculation is traditionally considered the "gold standard" method for influenza virus isolation and propagation. However, many primary cells and continuous cell lines have also been examined or developed for influenza virus isolation and replication. Specifically, influenza A virus in swine (IAV-S) isolation and propagation has been attempted and compared in embryonated chicken eggs, some primary porcine cells, and a number of continuous cell lines. Currently, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells remain the most commonly used cell line for the isolation, propagation, and titration of IAV-S. Virus isolation in embryonated chicken eggs or in different cell lines offers alternative approaches when IAV-S isolation in MDCK cells is unsuccessful. Optimal specimens for IAV-S isolation includes nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, oral fluids, bronchoalveolar lavage, lung tissues, and so on.

J	Carlberg, B; Franz, K; Gallus, W				Carlberg, Bradley; Franz, Kristie; Gallus, William, Jr.			A Method to Account for QPF Spatial Displacement Errors in Short-Term Ensemble Streamflow Forecasting	WATER			English	Article						ensemble streamflow prediction; flood forecasting; quantitative precipitation forecasts; spatial displacement errors	PRECIPITATION FORECASTS; CONVECTIVE INITIATION; MODEL; VERIFICATION; WRF; FLOOD; VARIABILITY; GENERATION; PREDICTION; EVOLUTION	To account for spatial displacement errors common in quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs), a method using systematic shifting of QPF fields was tested to create ensemble streamflow forecasts. While previous studies addressed spatial displacement using neighborhood approaches, shifting of QPF accounts for those errors while maintaining the structure of predicted systems, a feature important in hydrologic forecasts. QPFs from the nine-member High-Resolution Rapid Refresh Ensemble were analyzed for 46 forecasts from 6 cases covering 17 basins within the National Weather Service North Central River Forecast Center forecasting region. Shifts of 55.5 and 111 km were made in the four cardinal and intermediate directions, increasing the ensemble size to 81 members. These members were input into a distributed hydrologic model to create an ensemble streamflow prediction. Overall, the ensemble using the shifted QPFs had an improved frequency of non-exceedance and probability of detection, and thus better predicted flood occurrence. However, false alarm ratio did not improve, likely because shifting multiple QPF ensembles increases the potential to place heavy precipitation in a basin where none actually occurred. A weighting scheme based on a climatology of displacements was tested, improving overall performance slightly compared to the approach using non-weighted members.

J	Pan, C; Zhu, BB; Yu, CX				Pan, Cheng; Zhu, Binbin; Yu, Chenxu			A Dual Immunological Raman-Enabled Crosschecking Test (DIRECT) for Detection of Bacteria in Low Moisture Food	BIOSENSORS-BASEL			English	Article						SERS; bacterial detection; low moisture foods	GOLD NANOPARTICLES; IDENTIFICATION; SERS	Among the physical, chemical and biological hazards that could arise with respect to food safety, bacterial contamination has been one of the main concerns in recent years. Bacterial contamination in low moisture foods (LMFs) was an emerging threat which used to draw less attention as LMFs were considered at low risk of such a hazard. Bacteria can survive in low moisture environments and cause foodborne diseases once they enter the digestive system. Common detection methods such as ELISA and PCR are not well suited to LMFs, as most of them operate under aqueous environments. In this study, a Dual Immunological Raman-Enabled Crosschecking Test (DIRECT) was developed for LMFs using a nano-scaled surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) biosensor platform and multivariate discriminant analysis with a portable Raman spectrometer. It could provide a limit of detection (LOD) of 10(2) CFU/g of bacteria in model LMFs, with a detection time of 30-45 min. It has the potential to become a quick screening method for on-site bacteria detection for LMFs to identify food safety risks in real time.

Recently, researchers discovered that deep learning can significantly improve fringe analysis. However, deep learning requires numerous objects to be scanned for training data. In this paper, we propose to build the digital twin of an FPP system and pertbrm virtual scanning using computer graphics, which can significantly save cost and labor. The proposed method extracts 3D geometry directly from a single-shot fringe image, and real-world experiments have demonstrated the success of the virtually trained model. Our virtual scanning method can automatically generate 7,200 fringe images and 800 corresponding 3D scenes within 1.5 hours.

GRE and Undergraduate GPA as Predictors of Veterinary Medical School Grade Point Average, VEA Scores and NAVLE Scores While Accounting for Range Restriction	FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE			English	Article						academic achievement; admission predictors; GPA; GRE verbal; veterinary medical education; restriction of range; Veterinary Educational Assessment (VEA); North American Veterinary Licensing Exam (NAVLE)	GRADUATE RECORD EXAMINATION; STUDENT SELECTION; PERFORMANCE; ADMISSIONS; VALIDITY; PROGRAMS	We explored the relation between Undergraduate GPA (UGPA) and Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Verbal scores and several indices of achievement in veterinary medical education across five cohorts of veterinary students (N per model ranging from 109 to 143). Achievement indices included overall grade point average in veterinary school (CVMGPA), scores on the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination (NAVLE) and scores on the Veterinary Educational Assessment (VEA). We calculated zero order correlations among all measures, and corrected correlations for range restriction. In all cases, corrected correlations exceeded uncorrected ones. For each index of achievement, we conducted hierarchical regressions using the corrected correlations as input, entering UGPA in the first step and GRE Verbal in the second step. Overall, UGPA and GRE Verbal combined explained from 70 to 84% of variance in CVMGPA, 51-91% of variance in VEA scores, and 41-92% of variance in NAVLE scores. For 12 of 15 comparisons, the second step (including GRE Verbal scores) significantly improved R-2. Our results reaffirm the value of UGPA scores and GRE Verbal scores for predicting subsequent academic achievement in veterinary school.

This parasite is a more tractable nematode parasite for the experimental study of anthelmintic drugs and has been studied with patch-clamp and RNAi techniques. Unlike inC. eleganshowever, calcium signaling inB. malayior other nematode parasites has not been achieved, limiting the studies of the mode of action of anthelmintic drugs. We describe here the development of calcium imaging methods that allow us to characterize changes in cellular calcium in the muscles ofB. malayi. This is a powerful technique that can help in elucidating the mode of action of selected anthelmintics. We developed two approaches that allow the recording of calcium signals in the muscles of adultB. malayi: (a) soaking the muscles with Fluo-3AM, promoting large-scale imaging of multiple cells simultaneously and, (b) direct insertion of Fluo-3 using microinjection, providing the possibility of performing dual calcium and electrophysiological recordings. Here, we describe the techniques used to optimize dye entry into the muscle cells and demonstrate that detectable increases in Fluo-3 fluorescence to elevated calcium concentrations can be achieved inB. malayiusing both techniques.

Methods This cross-sectional study included 405 older adults (mean age, 72 yr). Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by time (s) to complete a 400-m walking test and MS by maximal handgrip strength (kg). Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity was used to assess AS. High AS was defined as a pulse wave velocity of >= 10 m center dot s(-1), a previously established threshold for increased cardiovascular risk. Poisson regression was used to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of having high AS across sex-specific tertiles of CRF and MS. Muscular strength and CRF were further dichotomized into either "weak" or "unfit" (lower one third for each), or "strong" or "fit" (upper two thirds for each) to investigate the combined associations of CRF and MS with high AS. All analyses were adjusted for potential confounders, including MS for CRF and CRF for MS. Results Sixty-nine (17%) participants had high AS. Compared with lower CRF, PR (95% CI) of having high AS were 0.53 (0.30-0.95) and 0.69 (0.38-1.23) for middle and upper CRF, respectively. Compared with lower MS, PR (95% CI) of having high AS were 0.81 (0.49-1.34) and 0.52 (0.29-0.92) for middle and upper MS, respectively. In the joint analysis, compared with the "unfit and weak" group, PR (95% CI) of having high AS were 0.72 (0.38-1.35), 0.58 (0.29-1.16), and 0.46 (0.25-0.85) for "unfit and strong," "fit and weak," and "fit and strong" groups, respectively. Conclusions Higher levels of CRF and MS were independently associated with lower (healthier) levels of AS in older adults.

In the United States, there are no drugs are approved for treatment of this pathogen. In this study, we evaluated in vitro anti-protozoal effects of compounds from an open access chemical library against T. foetus trophozoites. An initial high-throughput screen identified 16 compounds of interest. Further investigation revealed 12 compounds that inhibited parasite growth and 4 compounds with lethal effects. For lethal compounds, dose-response curves were constructed and the LD50 was calculated for laboratory and field strains of T. foetus. Our experiments revealed chemical scaffolds that were parasiticidal in the micromolar range, and these scaffolds provide a starting point for drug discovery efforts. Further investigation is still needed to investigate suitability of these scaffolds and related compounds in food animals. Importantly, open access chemical libraries can be useful for identifying compounds with activity against protozoan pathogens of veterinary importance.	[Martin, Katy A.; Chelladurai, Jeba R. J.

Comparison of heat lamps and heat mats in the farrowing house: effect on piglet production, energy use, and piglet and sow behavior through live observation	JOURNAL OF SWINE HEALTH AND PRODUCTION			English	Article						swine; farrowing; preweaning mortality; heat sources; energy use	MORTALITY	Objectives: To determine the effect of heat lamps versus heat mats on piglet performance measures, sow lying behavior, piglet behavior, and energy use. Materials and methods: Seventeen multiparous crossbred sows housed in farrowing stalls were randomly assigned to one of two heat source treatments: Baby Pig Heat Mat - Single 48 (MAT; n = 8) or Poly Heat Lamp Fixture (LAMP; n = 9). Piglets were weighed on day 1 and at weaning and any mortalities were recorded to evaluate piglet production measures. For 7 days over the course of lactation (day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, week before weaning, and day before weaning), sows and their litters were observed for 2 hours twice daily to evaluate behavior. Electric meters were attached to individual heat source units to monitor energy use. Results: Piglet production parameters were unaffected by treatment type; litter weaning weight (P = .85), litter average daily gain (P = .79), and preweaning mortality (P = .58). Piglet behavior had variation in the number of piglets using a heat source within day across treatments (P < .001). The number of piglets in contact with the sow decreased during early lactation for both treatment types and increased during late lactation with more MAT pigs tending to be in contact with the sow (P < .001).

While synergistic haemolysin inhibition (SHI) testing was negative, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis was cultured from the exudate, indicating a false negative result by the SHI test and the potential for a lack of reliability of this test in sheep with internal abscessation. Clinicians should be aware of the utility of diagnostic imaging as well as the use of endoscope-guided laser procedures in areas where traditional surgical approaches are challenging, such as the upper airway of sheep.

Simulation of Brain Response to Noncontact Impacts Using Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian Method	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						finite element (FE); cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL); spring connectors; noncontact impact	DIFFUSE AXONAL INJURY; WHITE-MATTER; HEAD-INJURY; MODEL; GRAY	Finite element (FE) method has been widely used for gaining insights into the mechanical response of brain tissue during impacts. In this study, a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) formulation is implemented in impact simulations of a head system to overcome the mesh distortion difficulties due to large deformation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) region and provide a biofidelic model of the interaction between the brain and skull. The head system used in our FE model is constructed from the transverse section of the human brain, with CSF modeled by Eulerian elements. Spring connectors are applied to represent the pia-arachnoid connection between the brain and skull. Validations of the CEL formulation and the FE model are performed using the experimental results. The dynamic response of brain tissue under noncontact impacts and the brain regions susceptible to injury are evaluated based on the intracranial pressure (ICP), maximum principal strain (MPS), and von Mises stress. While tracking the critical MPS location on the brain, higher likelihood of contrecoup injury than coup injury is found when sudden brain-skull motion takes place. The accumulation effect of CSF in the ventricle system, under large relative brain-skull motion, is also identified. The FE results show that adding relative angular velocities, to the translational impact model, not only causes a diffuse high strain area, but also cause the temporal lobes to be susceptible to cerebral contusions since the protecting CSF is prone to be squeezed away at the temporal sites due to the head rotations.

Beginning to offer drinking water at birth increases the species richness and the abundance of Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium in the gut of preweaned dairy calves	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						drinking water; Faecalibacterium; Bifidobacterium	BACTERIAL DIVERSITY; METHANE EMISSIONS; SEQUENCE DATA; RUMEN; MICROBIOME; MILK; COWS; MINERALS; TRAITS; IMPACT	We previously demonstrated that dairy calves having access to drinking water since birth (W0) achieved greater body weight, fiber digestibility, and feed efficiency than those that first received drinking water at 17 d of age (W17). Since gut microbiota composition could be linked to growth and development of animals, the objective of this study was to examine the effect of offering drinking water to newborn calves on composition of bacteria in the gut using a fecal microbiota analysis. Fresh feces were collected directly from the rectum of calves in W0 (n = 14) and W17 (n = 15) at 2, 6, and 10 wk of age. All of the calves were fed pasteurized waste milk, weaned at 7 wk of age, and offered tap water according to the treatment. The DNA was sequenced using 16S rRNA gene-amplicon sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq system (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). The sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTU) with a 99% similarity threshold. Treatment effects on alpha-diversity indices and relative abundance of the 10 most abundant genera were analyzed using GLIMMIX procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Statistical significance (q-value) of treatment effects on the 50 most abundant OTU was determined with a false discovery rate analysis. At 2 wk of age, W0 had a greater number of observed OTU (5,908 vs. 4,698) and species richness (Chao 1 index) than W17. The number of OTU and richness indices increased from wk 2 to 6, but the increment of W17 was greater than that of W0. The Shannon and inverse-Simpson indices increased linearly with age, but no difference was observed between W0 and W17 at any time point. The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratios were also similar at every time point but decreased markedly when calves were weaned. The relative abundance of genera Faecalibacterium and Bacteroides was greater in W0 than W17 at 2 wk of age. The genus Faecalibacterium continued to be more abundant in W0 than W17 at 6 wk of age but had similar abundance 3 wk after weaning (10 wk of age). The abundance of Faecalibacterium at wk 6 was positively correlated with apparent total-tract digestibility of acid detergent fiber at 10 wk of age. Calves receiving water since birth had greater abundance of OTU related to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Bifidobacterium breve at 6 wk of age (q < 0.085). These species are known to improve growth in preweaned calves. The abundance of none of the genera and OTU was different between W0 at W17 at 10 wk of age (q > 0.100). Overall, beginning to offer drinking water at birth has a potential to modulate gut microbiota composition and thereby positively affect performance of young dairy heifer calves (<= 10 wk of age).

J	Mullis, AS; Jacobson, SJ; Narasimhan, B				Mullis, Adam S.; Jacobson, Sarah J.; Narasimhan, Balaji			High-Throughput Synthesis and Screening of Rapidly Degrading Polyanhydride Nanoparticles	ACS COMBINATORIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						polyanhydride; high-throughput synthesis; drug delivery; nanoparticle; melting point depression; group contribution method	POLYMER CHEMISTRY; RELEASE KINETICS; RATIONAL DESIGN; PROTEIN RELEASE; DRUG-RELEASE; STABILITY; DEGRADATION; MECHANISMS; CHALLENGES; DELIVERY	Combinatorial techniques can accelerate the discovery and development of polymeric nanodelivery devices by pairing high-throughput synthesis with rapid materials characterization. Biodegradable polyanhydrides demonstrate tunable release, high cellular internalization, and dose sparing properties when used as nanodelivery devices. This nanoparticle platform shows promising potential for small molecule drug delivery, but the pace of understanding and rational design of these nanomedicines is limited by the low throughput of conventional characterization. This study reports the use of a high-throughput method to synthesize libraries of a newly synthesized, rapidly eroding polyanhydride copolymer based on 1,8-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)-3,6-dioxaoctane (CPTEG) and sebacic acid (SA) monomers. The high-throughput method enabled efficient screening of copolymer microstructure, revealing weak block-type and alternating architectures. The high-throughput method was adapted to synthesize nanoparticle libraries encapsulating hydrophobic model drugs. Drug release from these nanoparticles was rapid, with a majority of the payload released within 3 days. Drug release was dramatically slowed at acidic pH, which could be useful for oral drug delivery. Rhodamine B (RhoB) release kinetics generally followed patterns of polymer erosion kinetics, while Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) released the fastest from the slowest degrading polymer chemistry and vice versa. These differences in trends between copolymer chemistry and release kinetics were hypothesized to arise from differences in mixing thermodynamics. A high-throughput method was developed to synthesize polymer-drug film libraries and characterize mixing thermodynamics by melting point depression. Rhodamine B had a negative chi for all copolymers with <30 mol % CPTEG tested, indicating a tendency toward miscibility. By contrast, CBB chi increased, eventually becoming positive near 15:85 CPTEG:SA, with increasing CPTEG content. This indicates an increasing tendency toward phase separation in CPTEG-rich copolymers. These in vitro results screening polymer-drug interactions showed good agreement with in silico predictions from Hansen solubility parameter estimation and were able to explain the observed differences in model drug release trends.

INVITED REVIEW: Linking road transportation with oxidative stress in cattle and other species	APPLIED ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Review						animal health; feed efficiency; meat quality; trace minerals; vitamins	TRACE MINERAL INJECTION; MITOCHONDRIAL SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; FEED EFFICIENT BROILERS; SINGLE GENETIC LINE; DIETARY VITAMIN-E; GLUTATHIONE-PEROXIDASE; RESPIRATORY-DISEASE; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; ASCORBIC-ACID	Purpose: The primary objectives of this review were to describe how transportation stress can contribute to the development of oxidative stress and provide a synopsis of the available literature assessing transit-induced oxidative stress in livestock. Nutritional strategies to combat oxidative stress in cattle are also discussed. Sources: Sources of information for this review included peer-reviewed literature, unpublished data from research conducted by the authors, as well as government and industry reports. Synthesis: Transportation is an unavoidable component of beef production and involves both physical and psychological stressors that predispose cattle to disease and negatively affect growth performance and carcass characteristics. These stressors can also result in oxidative stress, which further depresses animal health, feed conversion efficiency, and meat quality. Conclusions and Applications: Although transit has been shown to alter biomarkers of oxidative stress in various livestock species, substantial variation exists regarding study conditions (species, transit duration, distance) and biomarker assessment (tissue, time of sampling, analytical methods). Future research should focus on determining appropriate oxidative stress biomarkers and establishment of a reference panel for livestock species. Furthermore, a more complete characterization of the oxidative stress response in cattle post-transit will help identify targets for the development of nutritional supplementation strategies (e.g., vitamins, minerals, yeast products) to mitigate the negative effects of transit-induced oxidative stress on cattle health and performance.

Evaluation of the need for negative moment reinforcing in prestressed concrete bridges in the view of service loads	ENGINEERING STRUCTURES			English	Article						Additional negative moment reinforcing steel (b2 bar); Secondary moment; Finite element modeling; Field test		It is common practice to put additional longitudinal reinforcement (b2 bars) over intermediate supports to resist any negative moment induced by the superimposed dead loads and live loads on bridges. However, little research has been conducted on the performance of the additional negative reinforcing steel. Requirements for the termination of the additional negative moment reinforcing steel have largely been based upon the engineering judgement, previous performance, and existing practice. The main objective of the research is to evaluate the effect of different amounts of b2 bars on resisting the negative moment over the pier on a continuous prestressed concrete girder bridge when it subject to the live load generated moment and secondary moment. To achieve this objective, a live load field test was performed on a bridge designed with different amounts of b2 bars to allow for comparison of the varying levels of negative moment reinforcement present. A full-scale finite element model was developed and validated against the field-collected data to study the b2 bar performance subjected to live loads. An evaluation was performed, utilizing an analytical approach by calculating the time-dependent secondary moment using mRESTRAINT and loading the beam-line FE model with the maximum negative moment. It was found that the negative moment induced by the live load and secondary moment does appear through the service life of the bridge. The high differential shrinkage rate between the fresh deck concrete and the girder concrete is the main source of the negative moment over the supports. The magnitude of the secondary moment was found to be highly influenced by the time when the continuity established. The results also indicated that the additional longitudinal reinforcing steel provides minimal effect on resistance to the negative moment prior to the formulation of deck cracking, regardless of whether the negative moment was induced by live loads or secondary moment. The current design approach determines the b2 bars requirement for the strength level based on the live load, it may be necessary to include the secondary moment in the design.

In the present work, electric biasing in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) fatigue tests are conducted on relaxors of (1-x)(Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3-xSrTiO(3). It is directly observed that the ceramic of x = 0.25 features an irreversible relaxor-ferroelectric phase transition and the domain walls in the metastable ferroelectric phase sweep shorter and shorter distances during cycling. In contrast, the ceramic of x = 0.27 features a reversible relaxor-ferroelectric transition and the domain walls in the transient ferroelectric phase remain highly mobile even after 10(4) cycles.

J	Yeager, TR; Struck, C				Yeager, Travis R.; Struck, Curt			Splash bridge models of inclined, gas-rich, direct galaxy collisions	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: numerical; ISM: kinematics and dynamics; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: interactions; galaxies: kinematics and dynamics	STAR-FORMATION; EMISSION	Splash bridges are formed from the direct inelastic collision of gas-rich galaxies. Recent multiwavelength observations of the Taffy galaxies, UGC 12914/15, have revealed complicated gas structures in the bridge. We have upgraded the sticky particle simulation code of Yeager & Struck by adding: the ability to adjust the relative inclination of the gas discs, the ability to track cloud-cloud collisions over time, and additional cooling processes. inclination effects lead to various morphological features, including filamentary streams of gas stripped from the smaller galactic disc. The offset of disc centres at impact determines whether or not these streams flow in a single direction or multiple directions, even transverse to the motion of the two galaxies. We also find that, across many types of direct collision, independent of the inclination or offset, the distributions of weighted Mach numbers and shock velocities in colliding clouds relax to a very similar form. There is good evidence of prolonged turbulence in the gas of each splash bridge for all inclinations and offsets tested, as a result of continuing cloud collisions, which in turn are the result of shearing and differentially accelerated trajectories. The number distribution of high velocity shocks in cloud collisions, produced in our low inclination models, are in agreement with those observed by Appleton et al. in the Taffy Galaxies with ALMA.

Cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment of structural bio-adhesives derived from glycerol	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Life cycle assessment (LCA); Glycerol; Structural bio-adhesive; RAFT polymerization; Allocation method; Sensitivity analysis	SUSTAINABILITY	Purpose Due to increasing environmental concerns about petroleum-based products, the replacement of petro-products has attracted much attention in recent years. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of glycerol-based structural bio-adhesive produced through the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization process. Methods In this study, two pathways of glycerol production were considered in this cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment: bio-glycerol produced from biodiesel production plant and petroleum-based glycerol derived from petroleum refineries. Several impact categories were analyzed including global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, and human health effects (both cancer and non-cancer). The impact of different allocation methods (energy content, mass value, and economic value) was also explored in this study. Results Our results showed that bio-glycerol-based structural adhesive had a lower environmental impact in general compared to petro-glycerol-based structural adhesive. Higher environmental impacts throughout the structural bio-adhesive life cycle were observed by adopting the energy allocation method. The key factors that influence the global warming potential were electricity sources and the product yield. Conclusions This LCA study provides useful information for developing sustainable biomaterials and processes. It is recommended to further explore the potential approaches to reduce the carbon intensity and eutrophication potential in the RAFT polymerization process as it is identified as the hotspot in the structural bio-adhesive production process.

J	Li, ZC; Zheng, JX				Li, Zhaochao; Zheng, Junxing			Nonlinear stability of the encased functionally graded porous cylinders reinforced by graphene nanofillers subjected to pressure loading under thermal effect	COMPOSITE STRUCTURES			English	Article						Thermal effect; Functionally graded porous; Buckling pressure; Encased cylinder; Nanofillers	LAMINATED CYLINDRICAL-SHELLS; FREE-VIBRATION ANALYSES; EXTERNAL-PRESSURE; DYNAMIC INSTABILITY; PIPE LININGS; PLATES; LINERS; BEHAVIOR; UNIFORM; NANOCOMPOSITES	This paper investigates the nonlinear stability of the functionally graded porous (FGP) cylinder reinforced by graphene nanofillers (GNF). Both the pores and GNF are distributed symmetrically in the cross-section of the cylinder. The FGP-GNF cylinder deforms radially-inward only due to the restraint of the tightly-fitting encasement. This radially-inward deformation can be expressed by a cosine function. Associated with the thin-walled shell algorithm and calculus of variation, the nonlinear equilibrium equations are obtained and solved to calculate the critical buckling pressure of the heated FGP-GNF cylinder. Later, numerical verification is accomplished by comparing the numerical and analytical buckling pressure. Furthermore, the present analytical and numerical results are compared with other closed-form predictions when the FGP-GNF cylinder reduces to a homogeneous one. Finally, the main attention is paid to the parameters that may affect the buckling pressure, including the thermal effect, porosity coefficient, weight fraction and geometric shape of the GNF, interface friction, and Young's modulus of the encasement.

We analyzed the recent history of style-fashion-dress through a queer lens by examining how queer identities have been negotiated on and around the body by women in the Midwest region of the United States from the late twentieth century to the present. Based on our research, we created an exhibition using community-participatory practices that allowed us to authentically tell the histories of ten queer-women's styles. We told stories that reflect some of the long-standing stereotypes of queer woman and the butch-femme dichotomy, but when we unpacked these histories, they more closely aligned with Kaiser and McCullough's "(k)notty model" metaphor. The women's garments, styles, and fashions represent the "shifting queer styles" that capture the lived experiences of midwestern queer women in the latter part of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

Design/methodology/approach The three algorithms for multi-objective aerodynamic optimization compared in this work are the combination of evolutionary algorithms, design space reduction and surrogate models, the multi-fidelity point-by-point Pareto set identification and the multi-fidelity sequential domain patching (SDP) Pareto set identification. The algorithms are applied to three cases, namely, an analytical test case, the design of transonic airfoil shapes and the design of subsonic wing shapes, and are evaluated based on the resulting best possible trade-offs and the computational overhead. Findings The results show that all three algorithms yield comparable best possible trade-offs for all the test cases. For the aerodynamic test cases, the multi-fidelity Pareto set identification algorithms outperform the surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm by up to 50 per cent in terms of cost. Furthermore, the point-by-point algorithm is around 27 per cent more efficient than the SDP algorithm. Originality/value The novelty of this work includes the first applications of the SDP algorithm to multi-fidelity aerodynamic design exploration, the first comparison of these multi-fidelity MOO algorithms and new results of a complex simulation-based multi-objective aerodynamic design of subsonic wing shapes involving two conflicting criteria, several nonlinear constraints and over ten design variables.

MPC is a promising technique in power system control, but its centralized implementation is computationally expensive for real-time application. A non-cooperative distributed-MPC framework is a computationally viable alternative. However in such framework, distributed agents acting selfishly optimize own utility functions, attaining a Nash equilibrium, which in general is less efficient with respect to the global cost/utility function of a dynamically coupled system. A cooperative alternative to this scheme distributively optimizes the global cost, but with an increase in computational complexity by a factor equal to the number of buses. In this paper, we introduce a pricing scheme to incentivize agents' individual utility functions in an iterative manner, improving the efficiency of non-cooperative Nash-equilibrium and attaining results comparable to global optimal of the centralized case. Additionally, to design the distributed-MPC framework, a distributed time domain simulation as well as trajectory sensitivity estimation framework, considering bus level decomposition, is developed and provided. Trajectory sensitivity supports linearization around a trajectory, attaining an accurate approximation of nonlinear dynamics. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed scheme is validated using the WECC 9 bus test system.

Although computation power has made significant progresses, it is still hard to deal with convolutional code with large block sizes. In this paper, we proposed a neural network based decoder termed Sequential Neural Network Decoder (SNND). The SNND consists of multiple sub models, and it passes the last state of the current sub model to the following model as the initial state. The bit error rate (BER) performance of the SNND remains unchanged as the number of sub models increases. It achieves a performance close to that of the soft decision Viterbi decoder under Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. However, the SNND's performance is found to decrease when the modulation order increases.

Malta's Water Scarcity Challenges: Past, Present, and Future Mitigation Strategies for Sustainable Water Supplies	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						groundwater quality; rainwater harvesting; water policy		The small Mediterranean country of Malta, an island located between Italy and North Africa, has been facing and will continue to face water stress and scarcity in the coming years, receiving the designation as the most water stressed country in Europe. In the past, Malta's water challenges were centered around water quantity concerns, but in more recent years, the severity of their water stress has been strengthened by the deterioration of the groundwater quality and quantity. Through the over-extraction of their groundwater, saltwater intrusion has steadily occurred into their freshwater aquifer systems, worsening their groundwater quality for both domestic and agricultural purposes. The objective of this paper is to conduct an extensive review on the history of Malta's water problems and how Malta is working to combat its water scarcity concerns. Additionally, this paper investigates the impact of Malta's water scarcity on its food and energy security challenges. Our study concludes that while Malta has obstacles to overcome in their pursuit of water security and sustainable development, the future remains hopeful, with several alternatives still available. Some of the alternatives explored in this review include wastewater reuse, increased awareness, use of alternative energy sources, rainwater harvesting, and implementation of nation-wide strategic water policies.

J	Bu, FK; Ma, ZX; Yuan, YX; Wang, ZY				Bu, Fankun; Ma, Zixiao; Yuan, Yuxuan; Wang, Zhaoyu			WECC Composite Load Model Parameter Identification Using Evolutionary Deep Reinforcement Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID			English	Article						WECC composite load model; parameter identification; evolutionary strategy; intelligent exploration	NETWORKS	Due to the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs), the load composition in distribution grids has significantly changed. This inverter-based device has notably different behavior from traditional static and induction motor loads. To accurately represent the combination of static load, induction motor and the emerging inverter-based devices, the composite load model with distributed generation (CMPLDWG) has been developed by Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC). Due to the large number of parameters and model complexity, the CMPLDWG model brings new challenges to parameter identification, which is critical to power system studies. To address these challenges, in this paper, a cutting-edge approach inspired by the evolutionary deep reinforcement learning (EDRL) with an intelligent exploration mechanism is innovatively proposed to perform parameter identification for CMPLDWG. First, to extract parameters contributions to dynamic power, parameter sensitivity analysis is conducted using a data-driven feature-wise kernelized Lasso (FWKL). Then, the EDRL with intelligent exploration, which can handle the natural high nonlinearity and nonconvexity of CMPLDWG, is employed to perform parameter identification. In the parameter identification process, the extracted parameter sensitivity weights are innovatively integrated into the EDRL with intelligent exploration to improve discovery efficiency.

Xylanase supplementation in corn-based swine diets: a review with emphasis on potential mechanisms of action	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Review						arabinoxylan; corn; fiber; pig; xylanase mechanism of action	DISTILLERS DRIED GRAINS; GROWING PIGS; NUTRIENT DIGESTIBILITY; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; NONSTARCH POLYSACCHARIDES; FERMENTABLE FIBER; ENERGY CONTENT; NURSERY PIGS; AMINO-ACIDS; WHEAT	Corn is a common energy source in pig diets globally; when financially warranted, industrial corn coproducts, such as corn distiller's dried grains with solubles (DDGS), are also employed. The energy provided by corn stems largely from starch, with some contribution from protein, fat, and non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). When corn DDGS are used in the diet, it will reduce starch within the diet; increase dietary protein, fat, and NSP levels; and alter the source profile of dietary energy. Arabinoxylans (AXs) comprise the majority of NSP in corn and its coproducts. One strategy to mitigate the antinutritive effects of NSP and improve its contribution to energy is by including carbohydrases within the diet. Xylanase is a carbohydrase that targets the beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds of AX, releasing a mixture of smaller polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, and pentoses that could potentially be used by the pig. Xylanase is consistently effective in poultry production and moderately consistent in wheat-based swine diets, but its efficacy in corn-based swine diets is quite variable. Xylanase has been shown to improve the digestibility of various components of swine-based diets, but this seldom translates into an improvement in growth performance. Indeed, a review of xylanase literature conducted herein suggests that xylanase improves the digestibility of dietary fiber at least 50% of the time in pigs fed corn-based diets, but only 33% and 26% of the time was there an increase in average daily gain or feed efficiency, respectively. Intriguingly, there has been an abundance of reports proposing xylanase alters intestinal barrier integrity, inflammatory responses, oxidative status, and other health markers in the pig. Notably, xylanase has shown to reduce mortality in both high and low health commercial herds. These inconsistencies in performance metrics, and unexpected health benefits, warrant a greater understanding of the in vivo mechanism(s) of action (MOA) of xylanase. While the MOA of xylanase has been postulated considerably in the literature and widely studied in in vitro settings, in wheat-based diets, and in poultry, there is a dearth of understanding of the in vivo MOA in pigs fed corn-based diets. The purpose of this review is to explore the role of xylanase in corn-based swine diets, discuss responses observed when supplemented in diets containing corn-based fiber, suggest potential MOA of xylanase, and identify critical research gaps.

Such riverine bridges often allow barges to pass underneath them on a daily basis, introducing the risk of barge collision. Considering that a barge collision can occur at any time prior to or during a hurricane, there are situations that a bridge pier damaged by a barge is not repaired when a hurricane occurs. This can be due to an inadequate assessment of pier damage, unavailability of resources for repair activities, or shortage of reaction time between the barge collision and the hurricane event. Such a multihazard risk, in which residual damage due to barge collision(s) increases the vulnerability of bridge piers to hurricane-induced wave loads, was largely unexplored in the literature. This motivated the current study to investigate a set of representative bridge piers under various barge collision and hurricane event scenarios. For this purpose, rigorous finite-element simulations are conducted to capture and compare the structural response of both intact and damaged bridge piers. With an in-depth understanding of deformation patterns and failure modes, the cumulative consequences of these two extreme events are determined in various combinations. This leads to the quantification of how hurricane-induced damage is magnified, making a bridge pier vulnerable to failure, as the extent of residual damage due to barge collision increases. The outcome of this systematic assessment is expected to help ensure the safety and functionality of the bridge structures that serve the coastal communities separated by rivers, especially during hurricane events.

J	Tuchin, K				Tuchin, Kirill			Time-evolution of magnetic field in hot nuclear matter with fluctuating topological charge	PHYSICAL REVIEW C			English	Article								The time-evolution of the magnetic field in hot homogeneous nuclear matter has two qualitatively different stages separated by the sphaleron transition time tau(c). At early times, when the chiral conductivity sigma(chi) is a slow function of time, the soft chiral modes k < sigma(chi) of the magnetic field grow exponentially with time, which is known as the chiral instability. At later times sigma(chi) fluctuates due to the sphaleron transitions and can be regarded as a random process. It is argued that the average magnetic field is exponentially damped at later times. The time-evolution of the average field energy is more complicated and depends on the electrical conductivity of the chiral matter but does not depend on chirality. It exhibits instability only if the matter is a poor electrical conductor, such as the quark-gluon plasma near the critical temperature. The precise conditions for the instability and the growth rate of the unstable modes are derived.

Dear Reviewer 2: Go F' Yourself	SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY			English	Article								Objectives The objective of this study was to empirically test the wide belief that Reviewer #2 is a uniquely poor reviewer. Methods The test involved analyzing the reviewer database fromPolitical Behavior. There are two main tests. First, the reviewer's categorical evaluation of the manuscript was compared by reviewer number. Second, the data were analyzed to test if Reviewer #2 was disproportionately likely to be more than one category below the mean of the other reviewers of the manuscript. Results There is no evidence that Reviewer #2 is either more negative about the manuscript or out of line with the other reviewers. There is, however, evidence that Reviewer #3 is more likely to be more than one category below the other reviewers. Conclusions Reviewer #2 is not the problem. Reviewer #3 is. In fact, he is such a bad actor that he even gets the unwitting Reviewer #2 blamed for his bad behavior.	[Peterson, David A.

Coupled with the need to bring more computation to the edge in resource-constrained embedded and IoT devices, specialized ultra-low power accelerators for spiking neural networks are being developed. Having a large variance in the models employed in these networks, these accelerators need to be flexible, user-configurable, performant and energy efficient. In this paper, we describe CyNAPSE, a fully digital accelerator designed to emulate neural dynamics of diverse spiking networks. Since the use case of our implementation is primarily concerned with energy efficiency, we take a closer look at the factors that could improve its energy consumption. We observe that while majority of its dynamic power consumption can be credited to memory traffic, its on-chip components suffer greatly from static leakage. Given that the event-driven spike processing algorithm is naturally memory-intensive and has a large number of idle processing elements, it makes sense to tackle each of these problems towards a more efficient hardware implementation. With a diverse set of network benchmarks, we incorporate a detailed study of memory patterns that ultimately informs our choice of an application-specific network-adaptive memory management strategy to reduce dynamic power consumption of the chip. Subsequently, we also propose and evaluate a leakage mitigation strategy for runtime control of idle power. Using both the RTL implementation and a software simulation of CyNAPSE, we measure the relative benefits of these undertakings. Results show that our adaptive memory management policy results in up to 22% more reduction in dynamic power consumption compared to conventional policies. The runtime leakage mitigation techniques show that up to 99.92% and at least 14% savings in leakage energy consumption is achievable in CyNAPSE hardware modules.

J	Tanchuk, N				Tanchuk, Nicolas			Is Inquiry Learning Unjust? Cognitive Load Theory and the Democratic Ends of Education	JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION			English	Article							CULTURALLY SUSTAINING PEDAGOGY; INSTRUCTIONAL-DESIGN; EQUALITY; OPPORTUNITY	Cognitive load theorists Paul Kirschner, John Sweller and Richard Clark argue that an array of inquiry-based pedagogies widely promoted in teacher preparation programmes are out of step with current cognitive science and should be eliminated for novice learners. According to these cognitive load theorists, inquiry-based pedagogies are likely to increase achievement gaps between the lowest and highest achieving students while reducing total learning. On almost any theory of justice in educational provision, an educational practice that results in the acquisition of fewer total educational goods by students and greater inequality in the distribution of goods will be considered unjust. I argue that inquiry-based pedagogies can be defended, even for novice learners, not as means to other goods but as embodiments of the least controversial liberal-democratic educational ends. I claim that once understood as part of the ends of liberal democratic education, inquiry-based pedagogies cannot be rightly eliminated from educational pathways. In addition, I argue that by interpreting cognitive load theory in light of uncontroversial liberal democratic educational ends, central claims about instructional design that are advanced by both cognitive load theorists and their opponents are either moderated or overturned. Most notably, the claim that there are no domain-general inquiry skills which need to be taught, which is advanced by cognitive load theorists against inquiry theorists, is revealed to be self-refuting. Integrating cognitive load theory into processes of liberal democratic problem-solving turns out to be a biologically secondary domain-general inquiry skill of just the sort cognitive load theorists deny exists.

The proposed converters are designed and simulated in a 65 nm CMOS process with standard I/O devices. With the proposed techniques, the output voltage fluctuations, including steady-state voltage ripples and over-/under-shoot voltages due to self- and cross-regulations during a 1.8 A load transient in 1 ns, are kept within 60 mV. The proposed converter delivers more than 3 A maximum load current per output and a maximum total output power above 6 W, with a peak efficiency above 90%. Compared to state-of-the-art SIMO converters, this work achieves a significantly higher output power capacity and faster dynamic response thus smaller self- and cross-regulations within 0.033 mV/mA.

Cumulative GPAs were also matched with respondents. Quantifying the relationship between library usage and student success is one of the six areas recommended for further research by ACRL. This study focuses on the variation and the uncertainty of the measurement of this relationship across disciplines, using Bayesian multilevel regression methods. Levels of library resource usage and percentages of respondents believing the library contributes very much to the respondents' academic success vary quite a bit by discipline. In this study, cumulative GPA is higher on average for students who use library resources more frequently, but not for students who receive library instruction. Although, for undergraduates, higher frequency of building usage predicted higher probability of believing the library contributes very much to academic success, it did not predict higher GPA.

Can climatic variables improve phenological predictions for butterfly species?

In this study, we developed two simple climatic models, one using yearly accumulated growing degree days (GDD) and the other using yearly accumulated shortwave radiation flux densities (SRAD), to determine if these variables can predict first emergence of three butterfly species with less error than an approach based on the average ordinal date of first observation at a site. Furthermore, we investigated whether combining our two models would increase our ability to predict the timing of first emergence. We determined that GDD models were better at predicting first emergence than were ordinal date models and SRAD models for all species tested; however, the actual variation among these models was so small that any additional effort required to develop GDD models would not justify their use as a replacement for the simpler ordinal date models at this time, although as climate changes they may become more useful. We also determined that combined models did not improve the ability to predict first emergence.

J	Thierry, H; Rogers, H				Thierry, Hugo; Rogers, Haldre			Where to rewild? A conceptual framework to spatially optimize ecological function	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						spatially explicit model; rewilding; seed dispersal; ecological function	SEED DISPERSAL; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; PACIFIC ISLAND; FOREST; MANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION; RESTORATION; REINTRODUCTION; TRADEOFFS	Rewilding is an approach aiming at restoring ecosystems to a self-sustaining state by restoring ecological function through active reintroductions or passive management. Locations for most rewilding-through-reintroduction efforts today are selected based on the suitability of the habitat for the reintroduced species, often with little consideration of where the ecological function is most needed. We developed the Spatial Planning of Rewilding Effort (Spore) framework to identify priority locations for rewilding projects through simultaneous consideration of habitat suitability and provisioning of ecological function. We use the island of Guam as a case study for a potential rewilding project, as the island has functionally lost all native seed dispersers as a result of the invasive brown treesnake (Boiga irregularis). The Sali (Micronesian starling, Aplonis opaca) is a good candidate for rewilding to restore ecological function, because it is an effective seed disperser with a localized remnant population. Using Spore, we identify three priority areas for the restoration of seed dispersal, each subdivided into management units. By recognizing the influence of landscape structure and the behaviour of the reintroduced species on the spatial pattern of the function provided by that species, this approach should lead to improved ecological outcomes.

J	Butler, T				Butler, Travis			Comprehensive moral thinking and the demandingness objection	BUSINESS AND SOCIETY REVIEW			English	Article						corporate responsibility; dignity; justice; stakeholders	HUMAN-DIGNITY	In his tripartite theory of corporate responsibility, Kenneth Goodpaster argues for the inclusion of "Comprehensive Moral Thinking (CMT)" as the third part alongside shareholder and stakeholder thinking. CMT requires managers sometimes to act for reasons of dignity or a just community, against what shareholder and stakeholder thinking recommend. To address concerns about the demandingness of CMT, Goodpaster argues that the responsibilities it imposes are significant but qualified or conditional: they require only that managers make efforts to address problems of dignity and justice, especially in cooperation with other willing firms. If extreme efforts are required or if other firms are unwilling to cooperate, managers can be justified in deciding in favor of shareholder or stakeholder values, even when dignity or justice is at stake. I raise two problems for the appeal to qualified responsibility-an extensional problem about the inability of the account to yield the correct judgment in important cases and an internal problem about the coherence of the account when qualified responsibility is included. I conclude by considering the prospects of a theory that includes CMT but rejects qualified responsibility.

However, disagreements may arise when we use different technologies to measure the topography of the same sample surface due to noise, sampling or optical properties of the sample surface, which may cause miscommunications or confusions between manufacturers. Thus, proposing methods for rating the similarities to match surface topographic data measured by various optical techniques is of crucial importance. This research investigates similarity evaluation methods for three-dimensional point-cloud topography data acquired by different technologies. Two different optical techniques (focus variation microscopy and structured light scanning) are used as testbeds. We propose two similarity evaluation methods for three-dimensional point-cloud data based on image distance method and Pearson's correlation coefficient. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods are effective and informative in determining whether the measured data are collected from the same sample, even though the measuring systems have different working principles and resolutions. This research facilitates our understanding of the discrepancies between different measuring systems, and meanwhile benefits a cyber-manufacturing system where unified inspection methods are unavailable among different manufacturers sharing the metrology data in cyber space.

Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated coordinates the ovarian DNA repair and atresia-initiating response to phosphoramide mustard	BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION			English	Article						DNA repair; ovary; ovotoxicity; oncofertility	BREAST-CANCER; SERTOLI-CELLS; MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION; PREMATURE MENOPAUSE; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; IN-VITRO; GENE; ATM; PROTEIN; DAMAGE	Ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) protein recognizes and repairs DNA double strand breaks through activation of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair proteins. Atm gene mutations increase female reproductive cancer risk. Phosphoramide mustard (PM) induces ovarian DNA damage and destroys primordial follicles, and pharmacological ATM inhibition prevents PM-induced follicular depletion. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 or Atm(+/-) mice were dosed once intraperitoneally with sesame oil (95%) or PM (25 mg/kg) in the proestrus phase of the estrous cycle and ovaries harvested 3 days thereafter. Atm(+/-) mice spent similar to 25% more time in diestrus phase than WT. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on ovarian protein was performed and bioinformatically analyzed. Relative to WT, Atm(+/-) mice had 64 and 243 proteins increased or decreased in abundance, respectively. In WT mice, PM increased 162 and decreased 20 proteins. In Atm(+/-) mice, 173 and 37 proteins were increased and decreased, respectively, by PM. Exportin2 (XPO2) was localized to granulosa cells of all follicle stages and was 7.2-fold greater in Atm(+/-) than WT mice. Cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 1 was 6.8-fold lower in Atm(+/-) mice and was located in the surface epithelium with apparent translocation to the ovarian medulla post-PM exposure. PM induced gamma H2AX, but fewer gamma H2AX-positive foci were identified in Atm(+/-) ovaries. Similarly, cleaved caspase-3 was lower in the Atm(+/-) PM-treated, relative to WT mice. These findings support ATM involvement in ovarian DNA repair and suggest that ATM functions to regulate ovarian atresia.

Reasons for this include the lack of flexibility of GANs to represent discrete-valued image data, as well as the lack of control over physical properties of generated samples. We propose a new conditional generative modeling approach (In-vNet) that efficiently enables modeling discrete-valued images, while allowing control over their parameterized geometric and statistical properties. We evaluate our approach on several synthetic and real world problems: navigating manifolds of geometric shapes with desired sizes; generation of binary two-phase materials; and the (challenging) problem of generating multi-orientation polycrystalline microstructures.

Researchers have used both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) images to determine scalar fabric parameters of granular soils, including void ratio, coordination number, and average branch vector length. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of 2D images to characterize fabric in 3D soils based on scalar parameters. The X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) is used to reconstruct the 3D volumetric images of three air-pluviated sand specimens, including crushed limestone, Griffin sand, and glass beads. Then, six slices are obtained by vertically cutting the 3D volumetric image in an angle increment of 30 degrees. The 3D and 2D images are analyzed to determine scalar fabric parameters. The results show that coordination numbers and average branch vector lengths computed from 2D images underestimate these values in 3D granular soils. The void ratios computed from 2D images vary a large range depending on slicing directions, which cannot provide reliable fabric characterizations for 3D granular soils.

Tomato seed value chain analysis and seed conditioning among seed companies in Uganda	INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article						tomato seed value chain; value chain analysis; seed conditioning; Uganda		Tomatoes increase nutritional food security and income among Ugandan smallholder farmers who have limited access to high quality seed. The objective of this study was to analyze the current tomato seed value chain for Uganda. Survey responses determined roles of key participants, including Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) for regulation and certification; National Agricultural Research Organization for breeding cultivars and seed multiplication; Makerere University for education and research; commercial seed companies for seed importation and conditioning; seed distributors for sales; and smallholder farmers as savers and end users of seed. Challenges included an inefficient domestic seed distribution system, technical constraints in seed production and conditioning by seed companies, inadequate networks and communication among the seed industry's key participants, and partial regulation of the seed industry. Seed companies played a key role in seed conditioning processes. Companies imported all tomato seeds into Uganda and stated germination as their primary goal for quality. Challenges for seed companies included assistance from MAAIF to regulate and certify seed and access to improved technologies. Attaining high quality seed by commercial Uganda-parent companies will require additional investment and training of seed technologists for domestic testing and seed quality assurance.

One common approach to control such systems for precision positioning is to model the system dynamics using a nonlinear model and linearize it using Taylor series, and then apply model predictive control (MPC). However, the control bandwidth and the control performance are quite limited as the obtained linear system is only guaranteed to be accurate within small neighborhood of the linearization point. To address this issue, we propose to linearize the nonlinear system model using Koopman operators and then use the obtained linear parameter-varying model for predictive control. This linearization scheme can significantly decrease the overall approximation error within the MPC prediction horizon, and thus, lead to improved tracking performance. The proposed approach was validated through trajectory tracking of piezo actuators in simulation.

J	Nguyen, HN; Markin, A; Friedberg, I; Eulenstein, O				Nguyen, Huy N.; Markin, Alexey; Friedberg, Iddo; Eulenstein, Oliver			Finding orthologous gene blocks in bacteria: the computational hardness of the problem and novel methods to address it	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	19th European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB)	SEP 07-08, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK				EVOLUTION; ANNOTATION; CLUSTERS; OPERONS	Motivation: The evolution of complexity is one of the most fascinating and challenging problems in modern biology, and tracing the evolution of complex traits is an open problem. In bacteria, operons and gene blocks provide a model of tractable evolutionary complexity at the genomic level. Gene blocks are structures of co-located genes with related functions, and operons are gene blocks whose genes are co-transcribed on a single mRNA molecule. The genes in operons and gene blocks typically work together in the same system or molecular complex. Previously, we proposed a method that explains the evolution of orthologous gene blocks (orthoblocks) as a combination of a small set of events that take place in vertical evolution from common ancestors. A heuristic method was proposed to solve this problem. However, no study was done to identify the complexity of the problem. Results: Here, we establish that finding the homologous gene block problem is NP-hard and APX-hard. We have developed a greedy algorithm that runs in polynomial time and guarantees an O(lnn) approximation. In addition, we formalize our problem as an integer linear program problem and solve it using the PuLP package and the standard CPLEX algorithm. Our exploration of several candidate operons reveals that our new method provides more optimal results than the results from the heuristic approach, and is significantly faster.

The developed NiCoMn-based trimetallic (NiCoMn-O) oxides has better electrical conductivity than any of its bimetallic or monometallic counterparts and the self-decorated nanoneedles on its surface can create more electroactive sites for electrolyte to access. 2 NiMoO4 layer is one of the important redox active materials in this composite since its high electrochemical activity in alkaline solution. 3. Carbon protection shell cannot only enhance the rate capability by shorting the electron transport pathway of the composite but also improve its cycling stability via buffering the volume change during the charge/discharge processes. Consequently, the obtained NiCoMn-O@NiMoO4@C electrode can provide a maximum specific capacitance of 2189.5 F/g (at 0.25 A/g) and 81.6% of its initial specific capacitance can be maintained after 1500 cycles GCD tests (at 6 A/g). The prepared NiCoMn-O@NiMoO4@C//AC hybrid supercapacitor exhibits the maximum energy density of 59.9 Wh/kg (at 0.25 A/g) and its specific capacitance can maintain 88.3% of its initial value after 3000 cycles GCD tests (at 6 A/g).

We drew upon the concepts of power, agency of the body, and dress and ambivalence to examine relationships between embodied practices, traveling, and society by conducting 15 semi-structured interviews with trans individuals. Through our work we argue that dress and appearance-related practices while traveling play an integral part of negotiating gender identities in ways that feel authentic to the self for trans individuals. Part of these authenticity negotiations sometimes involve moments of lacking authenticity through self-surveillance in order to manage liveable and safer lives in unknown or even familiar spaces.

Brachyspira hyodysenteriae Infection Reduces Digestive Function but Not Intestinal Integrity in Growing Pigs While Disease Onset Can Be Mitigated by Reducing Insoluble Fiber	FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE			English	Article						pig; Brachyspira hyodysenteriae; intestinal integrity; digestibility; nutrition; fermentable fiber; insoluble fiber	EPITHELIAL BARRIER FUNCTION; RESPIRATORY SYNDROME VIRUS; SWINE-DYSENTERY; FEED-INTAKE; EXPRESSION; DIARRHEA; DIETS; ABSORPTION; PHYSIOLOGY; CHALLENGE	Swine dysentery (SD) induced by Brachyspira hyodysenteriae manifests as mucohemorrhagic diarrhea in pigs, but little is known about the changes that occur to the gastrointestinal tract during this disease. It is thought that dietary fibers alter disease pathogenesis, although the mechanisms of action are unclear. Thus, the objectives of this study were to characterize intestinal integrity, metabolism, and function in pigs during SD and determine if replacing insoluble fiber with fermentable fibers mitigates disease. Thirty-six B. hyodysenteriae-negative gilts [24.3 +/- 3.6 kg body weight (BW)] were assigned to one of three treatment groups: (1) B. hyodysenteriae negative, control diet (NC); (2) B. hyodysenteriae challenged, control diet (PC); and (3) B. hyodysenteriae challenged, highly fermentable fiber diet (RS). The NC and PC pigs were fed the same control diet, containing 20% corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). The RS pigs were fed a diet formulated with 5% sugar beet pulp and 5% resistant potato starch. On days post inoculation (dpi) 0 and 1, pigs were inoculated with B. hyodysenteriae or sham. Pigs were euthanized for sample collection after onset of SD. The challenge had high morbidity, with 100% of PC and 75% of RS pigs developing clinical SD. The timing of onset of clinical SD differed due to treatment, with RS pigs having a delayed onset (dpi 9) of clinical SD compared with dpi 7 for PC pigs. Colon transepithelial resistance was increased and macromolecule permeability was reduced in PC pigs compared with NC pigs (P < 0.01). Minimal changes in ileal permeability, mitochondrial function, or volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were observed. Total VFA concentrations were lower in the colon and cecum in both PC and RS pigs compared to NC pigs (both P < 0.05), but iso-acids were higher (both P < 0.05). Total tract digestibility of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), nitrogen (N), and gross energy (GE) was lower in PC pigs compared with both NC and RS pigs (both P < 0.001). These data indicate that SD reduces digestive function but does not reduce ex vivo intestinal integrity. Further, replacement of insoluble fiber with highly fermentable fibers mitigated and delayed the onset of SD.

Yet there continues to be a lack of clarity about how PYD programs are defined and measured. Therefore, Common Measures 2.0 was created for assessing 4-H youth development programs. We examined the universal skills (intrapersonal and interpersonal) and engaged citizenship scales of Common Measures 2.0 through a survey of 175 participants at a 4-H youth leadership conference. Intrapersonal and interpersonal skills were significantly positively associated with engaged citizenship. The universal skills and engaged citizenship scales showed acceptable factor loadings and Cronbach's alpha values. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

To investigate ovarian impacts of chronic GLY exposure, female C57BL6 mice were orally administered saline as vehicle control (CT) or GLY at 0.25 (G0.25), 0.5 (G0.5), 1.0 (G1.0), 1.5 (G1.5), or 2 (G2.0) mg/kg for five days per wk. for 20 wks. Feed intake increased (P < .05) in G1.5 and G2.0 mice and body weight increased (P < .05) in G1.0 mice. There was no impact of GLY on estrous cyclicity, nor did GLY affect circulating levels of 17 beta-estradiol or progesterone. Exposure to GLY did not impact heart, liver, spleen, kidney or uterus weight. Both ovarian weight and follicle number were increased (P < .05) by G2.0 but not affected at lower GLY concentrations. There were no detectable effects of GLY on ovarian protein abundance of pAKT, AKT, pAKT:AKT, gamma H2AX, STAR, CYP11A1, HSD3B, CYP19A, ERA or ERB. Increased (P < .05) abundance of ATM protein was observed at G0.25 but not higher GLY doses. A dose-dependent effect (P < .10) of GLY exposure on ovarian protein abundance as quantified by LC-MS/MS was observed (G0.25-4 increased, 19 decreased; G0.5-5 increased, 25 decreased; G1.0-65 increased, 7 decreased; G1.5-145 increased, 2 decreased; G2.0-159 increased, 4 decreased). Pathway analysis was performed using DAVID and identified glutathione metabolism, metabolic and proteasome pathways as GLY exposure targets. These data indicate that chronic low-level exposure to GLY alters the ovarian proteome and may ultimately impact ovarian function.

Representing surface roughness in eddy resolving simulation	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS			English	Article						turbulence simulation	TURBULENT-BOUNDARY-LAYER; CHANNEL FLOW; WALL; MODEL	The motive behind the present paper is to investigate a method for representing the effect of surface roughness in eddy resolving simulations of turbulent flow, without including the geometric form of the roughness as a boundary. It is found that introducing a drag force, quadratic in a reference velocity, and confined to a zone next to the wall, is remarkably possible to capture the dominant effects of roughness. The drag representation is not new; indeed, it is motivated by Reynolds averaged models. The present assessment provides a new perspective on the fluid dynamical action of distributed roughness: its dominant effect is not to create eddies in the wake of asperities, or to provide a geometric obstruction. The drag model, with no geometrical features, suppresses streaks that occur over smooth walls, and generates large, outer region eddies, in a quite similar way to resolved roughness. In a sense, this is an expanded perspective on Townsend's hypothesis. As in that hypothesis, Reynolds stresses scale on friction velocity; but, expanding on the original hypothesis, spectra over the forcing layer agree closely with those over resolved roughness, when the force is calibrated to produce the same friction Reynolds number as the resolved roughness.

Soil physical disturbance and remediation practices including removal of topsoil, subsoil tillage and replacement of topsoil were investigated in a soybean-corn rotation field, which was located within a pipeline ROW. The objectives of the study were to investigate the effectiveness of subsoil tillage (300 and 450 mm) applied shortly after the pipeline installation used to help restore soil physical properties and to recover crop yields. Soil bulk density, soil cone index and crop yields (soybean and corn) from three ROW trafficked zones (Z1, Z2 and Z3) and adjacent unaffected zones were compared at one year and two years after pipeline installation. Compared to 300 mm of subsoil tillage in the ROW zones, 450 mm of subsoil tillage did not significantly improve the soil bulk density and crop (soybean and corn) yields. Compared to 300 mm of subsoil tillage, 450 mm of subsoil tillage created significantly lower soil cone index values within the treated soil layer. Compared to yield data from the adjacent unaffected zones, the ROW zones (Z1, Z2 and Z3) had statistically significant (p < .05) crop yield declines of 25% in soybean (2017) and 15% in corn (2018). The near-term soil physical properties and crop yield have been improved from the subsoil tillage applied in the affected zones; however, their recovery to normal conditions as in the unaffected areas has not been achieved within the 2-year period.

The Effect of a Liquid Phase on Force Distribution During Deformation in a Granular System	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article							STICK-SLIP; FLOW; STRESS; RHEOLOGY; BEHAVIOR; FRACTURE; ROCKS; FLUCTUATIONS; LUBRICATION; EVOLUTION	Two-phase systems, where one phase is solid and the other is fluid, are widespread in nature. Examples include reservoir rocks holding vital fluids like water or petroleum, slurries of partially crystallized magmas, fluids migrating along faults filled with fault gouge, and even the semibrittle crust. Previous studies of two-phase systems have shown that the fluid phase plays an important role in deformation localization and dynamics (e.g., Higashi & Sumita, 2009, https://doi.org/10.1029/2008JB005999; Reber et al., 2014, https://doi.org/10.1002/2014GL059832). Here, we present results from experiments investigating the influence of a fluid phase on force distribution in a granular media during simple shear. We use photoelastic polyurethane discs as the granular or solid phase and a linear viscous silicone as the fluid phase. The photoelastic property of the discs allows for direct observation and measurement of force magnitude and distribution. We compare the two-phase experiments to granular experiments without silicone. The addition and percentage of the fluid phase has a strong impact on the force distribution and the overall force chain orientations. In the two-phase system, the force chains form parallel to the shear plane and only rotate to the principal stress direction with an increase in strain. Locally, the fluid phase can support forces and terminate force chains over an extended period of time. Our results are in line with findings from numerical studies investigating the formation of slow slip events, proposing that these events are the result of dynamic interactions between solid and viscous phases. Plain Language Summary Systems containing a solid and a fluid phase are common in nature, including settings such as aquifers, petroleum reservoirs, water saturated fault sediments, and partially molten magmas. Previous work on two-phase systems has shown that the fluid phase is able to change deformation dynamics and increase deformation localization when compared to single-phase brittle systems. We conduct experiments using photoelastic discs as the solid phase and a silicone as the fluid phase. The photoelastic property allows for visualization and quantification of forces. We compare the two-phase experiments to granular experiments without silicone. Without silicone, force distributes along chains of discs that span the experimental apparatus. These force chains form in characteristic orientations that hold true throughout an experiment. The addition of the fluid phase significantly changes the force distribution. In two-phase experiments, force chains initially do not span the entirety of the experimental box and instead localize along a shear plane in the middle of the experiment. These force chain orientations change over time. We find that the fluid can support forces for extended periods of time. Our findings highlight the importance of the fluid phase on deformation in two-phase systems, which may have both economic and societal consequences.

Effects of the estrous cycle and pregnancy status on cardiovascular variables in healthy bitches	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						Echocardiography; Cardiac output; Heart murmur; Fetus	VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC FUNCTION; GOLDEN RETRIEVER PUPPIES; SUBAORTIC STENOSIS; CARDIAC-OUTPUT; HEART-RATE; ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; DOGS; VELOCITY; VOLUME; HEMODYNAMICS	Introduction: The aim of the study was to characterize changes in maternal cardiovascular variables throughout the reproductive cycle in healthy bitches and determine whether magnitude of pregnancy-induced changes correlates to litter size. Animals: Eleven client-owned breeding bitches were included in the study. Materials and methods: Bitches were enrolled prospectively and followed up longitudinally throughout a single reproductive cycle. Physical examination, echocardiography, blood pressure analysis, and plasma volume estimation were performed during proestrus, diestrus (early and late pregnancy), and anestrus. Fetal echocardiography was performed during late pregnancy. Data were compared across visits using a linear mixed-effects model, and correlation between variables was assessed. Results: Compared with proestrus, no significant changes were observed at any phase of the cycle in heart rate, blood pressure, echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular size or function, or echocardiographic calculations of stroke volume or cardiac output. Estimated plasma volume increased by 29.6% in early pregnancy (p < 0.001) and 70.7% in late pregnancy (p < 0.001). Fetal echocardiography was feasible in a subset of fetuses for each bitch. There was a significant correlation between estimated total fetal cardiac output and late pregnancy increase in maternal cardiac output (p = 0.0025). The incidence of physiologic heart murmurs ranged from 5 of 11 (45%) bitches in proestrus to 2 of 11 (18%) bitches in late pregnancy, attributed to variations in aortic outflow velocity. Conclusions: Hemodynamic alterations in pregnant bitches do not result in consistently detectable echocardiographic changes, suggesting that cardiac screening could be diagnostic at any time during a reproductive cycle. Physiologic heart murmurs were common in this study population and not obviously associated with the reproductive cycle. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Host immunity and the colon microbiota of mice infected with Citrobacter rodentium are beneficially modulated by lipid-soluble extract from late-cutting alfalfa in the early stages of infection	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GUT MICROBIOTA; SEQUENCE DATA; SAPONINS; DISEASE; STEM; MATURITY; POLYSACCHARIDE; INFLAMMATION; QUERCETIN; RESPONSES	Alfalfa is a forage legume commonly associated with ruminant livestock production that may be a potential source of health-promoting phytochemicals. Anecdotal evidence from producers suggests that later cuttings of alfalfa may be more beneficial to non-ruminants; however, published literature varies greatly in measured outcomes, supplement form, and cutting. The objective of this study was to measure body weight, average daily feed intake, host immunity, and the colon microbiota composition in mice fed hay, aqueous, and chloroform extracts of early (1(st)) and late (5(th)) cutting alfalfa before and after challenge withCitrobacter rodentium. Prior to inoculation, alfalfa supplementation did not have a significant impact on body weight or feed intake, but 5(th)cutting alfalfa was shown to improve body weight at 5- and 6-days post-infection compared to 1(st)cutting alfalfa (P= 0.02 and 0.01). Combined with the observation that both chloroform extracts improved mouse body weight compared to control diets in later stages ofC.rodentiuminfection led to detailed analyses of the immune system and colon microbiota in mice fed 1(st)and 5(th)cutting chloroform extracts. Immediately following inoculation, 5(th)cutting chloroform extracts significantly reduced the relative abundance ofC.rodentium(P= 0.02) and did not display the early lymphocyte recruitment observed in 1(st)cutting extract. In later timepoints, both chloroform extracts maintained lower splenic B-cell and macrophage populations while increasing the relative abundance of potentially beneficially genera such asTuricibacter(P= 0.02). At 21dpi, only 5(th)cutting chloroform extracts increased the relative abundance of beneficialAkkermansiacompared to the control diet (P= 0.02). These results suggest that lipid soluble compounds enriched in late-cutting alfalfa modulate pathogen colonization and early immune responses toCitrobacter rodentium, contributing to protective effects on body weight.

Our purpose in this study is to extend the theoretical parameters of group position into the domain of immigration by defining prejudice in terms of non-immigrant Americans versus immigrants. We find cultural identity threat and subjective economic threat are more significant in informing attitudes toward immigration than objective economic threat. This finding is consistent with and confirms Blumer's argument that prejudice as a sense of group position is primarily derived from feelings, and is therefore subjective in nature.

In Study 1, an initial pool of items was developed with 615 older adults, 65 years of age and older. The scale was reduced to a 15-item version for use in applied health care settings. Results indicated that the 'Health Personality Assessment scale' has good internal consistency, and the five-factors correlated significantly with self-reported measures of physical health and well-being. In Study 2, the scale was cross-validated with 254 older adults from the Health Literacy and Cognitive Function among Older Adults Study. The scale was refined and a third study consisted of 3,907 older adults. Reliability and validity of the scale were confirmed. Future research should evaluate the usefulness of this scale in applied healthcare settings.

Many studies have explored the correlation between microcystin concentrations and abundances of toxin-producing genes (e.g., mcyA genes) measured using quantitative PCR, and discrepancies between toxin concentrations and gene abundances are often observed. In this study, the results show that these discrepancies are at least partially due to primer sets that do not capture the phylogenetic diversity of naturally present toxin-producers. We designed three novel primer gene probes based on known mcyA genes to improve the detection and quantification of these genes in environmental samples. These primers were shown to improve the identification of mcyA genes compared to previously published primers in freshwater metagenomes, cyanobacterial isolates, and lake water samples. Unlike previously published primers, our primer sets could selectively amplify and resolve Microcystis, Anabaena, and Planktothrix mcyA genes. In lake water samples, abundance estimations of mcyA genes were found to correlate strongly with microcystin concentrations. Based on our results, these primers offer significant improvements over previously published probes to accurately identify and quantify mcyA genes in the environment. There is an increasing need to develop models based on microbial information and environmental factors to predict CyanoHABs, and improved primers will play an important role in aiding monitoring efforts to collect reliable and consistent data on toxicity risks.

However, the configuration could not be symbolically analyzed like its single-band counterpart due to the complicated nature of dual-band signals. This brief aims to provide a theoretical basis for idealized concurrent dual-band class-D operation. It applies an alternate representation of the sum of two sinusoids which helps the formulation of a technique to analytically extract the complex Fourier series coefficients of the current and voltage waveforms of the power amplifier. Expressions for output power and efficiency are derived, showing a theoretical drain efficiency of 100%. The theoretically obtained results are validated using observations from literature as well as independent Harmonic Balance simulation.

Sweat monitoring beneath garments using passive, wireless resonant sensors interfaced with laser-ablated microfluidics	NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE			English	Article							WEARABLE SENSORS; SODIUM; DEHYDRATION; HYDRATION; EXERCISE	Sweat loss can help determine hydration status of individuals working in harsh conditions, which is especially relevant to those who wear thick personal protective equipment (PPE) such as firefighters. A wireless, passive, conformable sweat sensor sticker is described here that can be worn under and interrogated through thick clothing to simultaneously measure sweat loss volume and conductivity. The sticker consists of a laser-ablated, microfluidic channel and a resonant sensor transducer. The resonant sensor is wirelessly read with a handheld vector network analyzer coupled to two, co-planar, interrogation antennas that measure the transmission loss. A sweat proxy is used to fill the channels and it is determined that the sensor can orthogonally determine the sweat conductivity and volume filled in the channel via peak transmission loss magnitude and frequency respectively. A four-person study is then used to determine level of sensor variance caused by local tissue dielectric heterogeneity and sensor-reader orientation.

Fluorescence quenching of the SYBR Green I-dsDNA complex by in situ generated magnetic ionic liquids	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						DNA; In situ magnetic ionic liquids; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Fluorescence quenching; Fluorescence resonance energy transfer; Stern-Volmer relationship	DNA EXTRACTION; SOLVENTS; CHEMISTRY	Magnetic ionic liquids (MILs) with metal-containing cations are promising extraction solvents that provide fast and high efficiency extraction of DNA. Hydrophobic MILs can be generated in situ in a methodology called in situ dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction. To consolidate the sample preparation workflow, it is desirable to directly use the DNA-enriched MIL microdroplet in the subsequent analytical detection technique. Fluorescence-based techniques employed for DNA detection often utilize SYBR Green I, a DNA binding dye that exhibits optimal fluorescence when bound to double-stranded DNA. However, the MIL may hinder the fluorescence signal of the SYBR Green I-dsDNA complex due to quenching. In this study, MILs with metal-containing cations were selected and their fluorescence quenching effects evaluated using Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and quantified using Stern-Volmer models. The MILs were based on N-substituted imidazole ligands (with butyl- and benzyl- groups as substituents) coordinated to Ni2+ or Co2+ metal centers as cations, and paired with chloride anions. The effects of NiCl2 and CoCl2 salts and of the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid on the fluorophore complex were also studied to understand the components of the MIL structure that are responsible for quenching. The metal within the MIL chemical structure was found to be the main component contributing to fluorescence quenching. Forster critical distances between 11.9 and 18.8 angstrom were obtained for the MILs, indicating that quenching is likely not due to non-radiative energy transfer but rather to spin-orbit coupling or excited-state electron transfer. The MILs were able to be directly used in qPCR and fluorescence emission measurements using a microplate reader for detection, demonstrating their applicability in fluorescence-based detection methods.

Effects of Modern Concrete Materials on Thermal Conductivity	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Concrete; Thermal conductivity; Supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs); Lightweight aggregate; Recycled aggregate; Fiber	RECYCLED AGGREGATE CONCRETE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; PREDICTION; STRENGTH; IMPACT	Thermal conductivity, k, is one of the key factors that control heat transfer in concrete. This paper presents the results of an experimental study conducted to analyze the effects of modern concrete materials, such as supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), normal-weight, lightweight, and recycled aggregates, and steel and polypropylene (PP) fibers, on the thermal conductivity of concrete. The thermal conductivity tests were performed on cylindrical specimens of concrete mixes containing various amounts of these materials. The results indicate that k values of concrete reduced with the amount of SCM (slag and fly ash) replacement for cement. The mineralogy and absorption of normal weight aggregate considerably affect k value of concrete. Replacing normal weight coarse aggregate by lightweight or recycled aggregate reduced the k value of concrete. Addition of steel fiber at a dosage higher than 0.25% (by volume) increased k value of concrete noticeably, whereas the addition of up to 2% PP fiber showed little effect.

Effect of subclinical and clinical hypocalcemia and dietary cation-anion difference on rumination activity in periparturient dairy cows	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						hypocalcemia; rumination; milk fever; dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD)	CALCIUM; PHOSPHORUS; ASSOCIATION; PERFORMANCE; METABOLISM; LACTATION; MOTILITY; MUSCLE; RUMEN; RISK	Rumination involves a complex series of muscle contractions that bring a bolus of ingesta to the mouth for further mastication before it is swallowed again. Healthy cows ruminate 8 to 9 h/d. Hypocalcemia is known to disrupt nerve and muscle function. Our hypothesis was that hypocalcemia in periparturient cows would reduce rumination activity. Twenty-six Holstein cows entering their third lactation or greater were fed a control diet [dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) = +196 mEq/kg of dry matter (DM)] or a low DCAD diet supplemented with anions (DCAD = -9 mEq/kg of DM) preparturn. Periparturient plasma Ca concentration and rumination rate were determined. Four of 12 control cows developed clinical milk fever, necessitating intravenous Ca therapy. Rumination rate decreased in all cows around the time of calving. Rumination rate on the first and second day of lactation was highly correlated with the cow's plasma Ca concentration on the first day of lactation. In one of our statistical models, a normocalcernic cow was defined as a cow whose plasma Ca concentration remained above 2.00 mM. Cows were retrospectively classified as normocalcemic, subclinically hypocalcemic, or clinically hypocalcemic (milk fever). Only 4 cows were considered normocalcemic, and all had been fed the low DCAD diet. Normocalcemic cows spent more time ruminating on the first day after calving than subclinically hypocalcemic cows or cows with milk fever. Cows with milk fever had a lower rumination rate than normocalcemic cows through d 3 of lactation. Rumination activity in cows with milk fever was almost nondetectable in the hours before and after intravenous Ca treatment for an extended period, despite the return of muscle function that allowed the cows to stand and eructate following treatment. Other statistical models using different definitions of normocalcemia gave qualitatively similar results. Diet had a great effect on plasma Ca concentration and rumination rate. Even when cows with clinical milk fever were removed from the control cow data set, cows on the low DCAD diet had significantly greater plasma Ca concentrations in the first 36 h after calving and a higher rumination rate on d 1 of lactation (248 +/- 26 min) than control cows (158 +/- 32 min).

J	Pinto, I; Buss, A				Pinto, Irvin; Buss, Ashley			zeta Potential as a Measure of Asphalt Emulsion Stability	ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							BITUMEN DISPLACEMENT; WATER	Asphalt emulsions are most often oil-in-water emulsions widely used in pavement preservation treatments as a result of lower application temperatures and versatility for many pavement preservation applications. Asphalt emulsion stability is an important parameter to consider when choosing the type and formulation of an emulsion for a specific pavement preservation treatment. The stability of asphalt emulsions depends upon the suspension of charged asphalt particles in an electrolyte solution. The particle size and ionic stability play an important role, and zeta potential provides a quantitative measure for tracking the stability of the emulsion. zeta potential is the potential difference between the charged asphalt droplet surface in a dispersed phase and oppositely charged ions in a water-emulsifier solution that make up the continuous phase. A high positive or negative zeta potential indicates a stable emulsion, while zeta potential values approaching zero indicate flocculation. This study will consist of two phases. The first phase presents an experimental design to observe the effect of various formulation parameters on the zeta potential of quick-setting asphalt emulsions and create a statistical model of important effects. The second phase studies the influence of aggregate fines of varying reactivity in the asphalt emulsion and determine the point of zero zeta potential for each formulation. This study aims to introduce the parameter of zeta potential in the design process of slurry-seal pavement preservation treatments and help improve the mixture design process and field performance of quick-setting asphalt emulsion mixtures.

Characterizing and Predicting Protein Hinges for Mechanistic Insight	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Protein hinge prediction; Alpha shape; Zika virus hinges; Flexible peptide linkers; Domain identification	DNA-POLYMERASE-BETA; DOMAIN MOVEMENTS; ATP HYDROLYSIS; DYNAMICS; MOTIONS; INHIBITION; CALMODULIN; HELICASE; MODELS	The functioning of proteins requires highly specific dynamics, which depend critically on the details of how amino acids are packed. Hinge motions are the most common type of large motion, typified by the opening and closing of enzymes around their substrates. The packing and geometries of residues are characterized here by graph theory. This characterization is sufficient to enable reliable hinge predictions from a single static structure, and notably, this can be from either the open or the closed form of a structure. This new method to identify hinges within protein structures is called PACKMAN. The predicted hinges are validated by using permutation tests on B-factors. Hinge prediction results are compared against lists of manually curated hinge residues, and the results suggest that PACKMAN is robust enough to reproduce the known conformational changes and is able to predict hinge regions equally well from either the open or the closed forms of a protein. A group of 167 protein pairs with open and closed structures has been investigated Examples are shown for several additional proteins, including Zika virus nonstructured (NS) proteins where there are 6 hinge regions in the NS5 protein, 5 hinge regions in the NS2B bound in the NS3 protease complex and 5 hinges in the NS3-helicase protein. Results obtained from this method can be important for generating conformational ensembles of protein targets for drug design. PACKMAN is freely accessible at (https://PACKMAN.bb.iastate. edu/).

It is frequently used in automotive, off-road, and industrial environments with several IoT nodes connected to it. Control messages with commands can cause an actuator to perform some action. An adversary might observe the control message and subsequent action. Injecting the control message at a later time (replay attack) should not replay the same action. Unfortunately current CAN protocol provides no protection against such attacks. Third party components may reverse engineer messaging protocols to gain control over critical systems resulting in dangerous system malfunctions. In a connected vehicle ecosystem, these attacks can also originate at peer vehicles with transactions coming in through one of the IoT nodes on the CAN bus. The proposed solution is to verify the integrity and authenticity of messages. Verifying the integrity of a freshness value appended to messages prevents replay attacks. Authenticity guarantees messages do not come from a malicious party. A keyed hash function using a shared secret key enables authenticated messages. The challenges are: (1) establishing a shared secret and (2) synchronizing a freshness value. Past standards limit CAN message sizes to 8 bytes. New standards (CAN-FD) allow for longer messages. We propose appending 8 bytes to messages to provide integrity and authenticity. Nodes require a shared key and freshness value for creating these bytes. Many scenarios require shared key renegotiation. The shared key is negotiated using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) infrastructure. Protocols are developed for establishing a shared key and synchronizing a freshness value. Protocol correctness is verified through simulations.

This question also affects the estimation of quarkonia breakup cross-sections and color screening in heavy ion collisions. Many existing models describe well general features of quarkonia production like cross-section and transverse momentum distributions. In order to differentiate between various models one has to study quarkonia production in more details. One of such tools is a study of angular distributions of decay leptons, usually called polarization. The PHENIX experiment has measured inclusive J/psi polar and azimuthal angular decay coefficients in the mid (vertical bar y vertical bar < 0.35) and forward (1.2 < vertical bar y vertical bar< 2.2) rapidity regions in p+p collisions at 200 GeV and 510 GeV. This talk will present the analysis strategy as well as the results in different polarization frames.

To fully characterize an op amp, sophisticated analog and digital testing is required, which is expensive. Fault detection techniques have proved to reduce package cost and test cost by detecting faulty devices early in the test sequence. In this paper, a simple Design for Test (DfT) technique called intentional offset injection is proposed to detect various faults in the op amp. As our proposed method is completely digital, pure digital circuitry can be used, thereby avoiding expensive analog testing. The op amp can be tested with the proposed fault detection method during wafer probe test right after the continuity tests and the faulty devices could be discarded, thereby circumventing time-consuming analog testing. Additionally, our detection scheme can be used for power-on self-test after deployment and for online health monitoring during normal operation. We show that the proposed detection method can provide high fault coverage of 95% with modest area requirements. In this work, we also introduce a detector called digital window comparator which is used to monitor faults in the biasing circuit as well as in the Widlar current reference providing increased fault coverage.

Experimental Feasibility Study of Tunable-Stiffness Polishing Wheel via Integration of Magneto-Rheological Elastomers	MECHANICS OF COMPOSITE AND MULTI-FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS, VOL 5	Conference Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Mechanics Series		English	Proceedings Paper	Society-for-Experimental-Mechanics (SEM) Annual Conference and Exposition on Experimental and Applied Mechanics	JUN 03-06, 2019	Reno, NV	Soc Experimental Mech		Tunable composites; Magnetorheological elastomers; Chemical mechanical polishing; Magnetostriction		The mechanical polishing is one of the critical microfabrication processes in semiconductor and a host of other critical industries. There has been a great effort in consumable development (pads, slurries, etc.) to improve the overall polishing efficiency and resulting surface quality. In this study, we explored a unique composite polishing wheel with integration of magnetorheological elastomers (MREs). The proposed design aims to control local contact area and contact pressure during fine polishing process and thereby control the material removal rate with precise adjustment of the magnetic field. Two (Two MRE microstructure) MRE, isotropic and chain structured orthotropic, materials were included in the design. The feasibility of the designed wheel and the workpiece-wheel contact characteristics were tested under compression loading. An experimental setup was designed to apply vertical and horizontal magnetic fields. Digital image correlation technique was utilized to measure the local in-plane strain field around contact region. It was found that addition of MRE inserts can alter the local stress field around the contact area, resulting in a strong modulation with up to three-fold increase of both the contact area and the local pressure distribution. Finite element analysis highlighted the intricate role of the MRE inserts in modulating the local strain field around the contact area, and thereby inducing a concurrent increase in both the contact area and the local pressure distribution under the same nominal macroscopic applied load. The observed demand modulation of the contact pressure is anticipated to have a marked effect on the polishing process and the resulting surface quality.

The challenge is especially difficult because the catalyst needs to distinguish the inversion of a single hydroxyl and the alpha or beta glycosidic bonds that join monosaccharide building blocks. Here, we report synthetic glycosidase prepared through molecular imprinting within a cross-linked micelle. The nanoparticle catalyst resembles natural enzymes in dimension, water solubility, and a hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface-core topology. Its boronic acid functionalized active site binds its targeted glycoside substrate and an acid cofactor simultaneously, with the acidic group in close proximity to the exocyclic glycosidic oxygen. The hydrophobically anchored acid cofactor is tunable in acidity and causes selective cleavage of the targeted glycoside in mildly acidic water. Selectivity for both the glycan and the alpha/beta glycosidic bond can be rationally designed through the molecular imprinting process.

J	Sankhye, S; Hu, GP				Sankhye, Sidharth; Hu, Guiping			Machine Learning Methods for Quality Prediction in Production	LOGISTICS-BASEL			English	Article						machine learning; quality; classification	NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE	The rising popularity of smart factories and Industry 4.0 has made it possible to collect large amounts of data from production stages. Thus, supervised machine learning methods such as classification can viably predict product compliance quality using manufacturing data collected during production. Elimination of uncertainty via accurate prediction provides significant benefits at any stage in a supply chain. Thus, early knowledge of product batch quality can save costs associated with recalls, packaging, and transportation. While there has been thorough research on predicting the quality of specific manufacturing processes, the adoption of classification methods to predict the overall compliance of production batches has not been extensively investigated. This paper aims to design machine learning based classification methods for quality compliance and validate the models via case study of a multi-model appliance production line. The proposed classification model could achieve an accuracy of 0.99 and Cohen's Kappa of 0.91 for the compliance quality of unit batches. Thus, the proposed method would enable implementation of a predictive model for compliance quality. The case study also highlights the importance of feature construction and dataset knowledge in training classification models.

JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN MEMORY AND COGNITION			English	Article						Eyewitness memory; Eyewitness identification; Recognition memory; Mirror effect; Signal detection theory	MEMORY; STRENGTH; MODEL; EQUIVALENCE; DIFFERENCE; TARGET	I examined why mistaken identifications increase when either witnessing or testing conditions get worse. In Experiment 1 (N = 633), participants watched either a clear or degraded version of a simulated crime. In Experiment 2 (N = 1266), all participants watched the same version of the crime, but were then randomly assigned to either a clear or noise-degraded lineup. After indicating which lineup member best matched their memory for the culprit, participants indicated how well that lineup member matched their memory for the culprit. Degraded conditions led to fewer culprit identifications from present lineups and more mistaken identifications from absent lineups. Degrading witnessing/testing conditions resulted in lower memory ratings for the culprit, but memory ratings for the best-matching innocent person were statistically equivalent under clear and degraded conditions. These results suggest that the reason mistaken identifications increase when witnessing/testing conditions get worse is because witnesses lower their criterion for making an affirmative identification.

The Social Desirability of Rallying 'Round the Flag	POLITICAL BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Foreign policy; Social desirability; Behavioral measures; Attitudes; Names	1ST NAMES; ATTITUDES; WAR; FOREIGN; COUNT; BIRTH; CONFORMITY; PATRIOTISM; QUESTIONS; PATTERNS	Identifying the sincerity of shifts in public opinion is difficult: survey settings involve social pressure to provide seemingly popular answers. Names for newborn children in the United States provide an alternative, behavioral measure that can indicate the presence of social-desirability bias. First names typically exceed middle names in visibility and hence sensitivity to social-desirability effects. First names should therefore be more likely to change when name-givers wish to conform to widespread sentiments they do not share. This hypothesis is explored during foreign-policy crises (rallies): French-derived first, but not middle, names declined as anti-French sentiment rose around the 2003 Iraq War, yet no analogous divergence emerged after the 11 September 2001 attacks. Treating all rallies as equally meaningful may then produce misleading analyses of public opinion; seeming waves in political views may reflect conformist dissimulation rather than actual attitudes.

We used high-voltage alternative current electricity as the plasma source in polar aprotic solvents to achieve complete liquefaction of cellulose without the use of external heating. A levoglucosenone yield of 43% was obtained after 15 min of conversion in gamma-valerolactone using a voltage of 6 kV and frequency of 6 kHz, and a 38% yield was obtained within 3 min in sulfolane using a voltage of 4 kV (or 40% after treating for 7 min with the voltage of 3.5 kV). Compared to conventional liquefaction in the same solvents, plasma electrolysis could produce much greater LGO yields using significantly less energy. In this study, the plasma electrolysis of cellulose in gamma-valerolactone was able to increase the levoglucosenone yield by 154% while using only 28% of the energy consumed during conventional thermal-based conversion of cellulose in the same solvent for producing its maximum yield of 17%. When the same conversions were performed in sulfolane, a 28% higher levoglucosenone yield was produced while requiring only 3% of the energy consumed during the respective thermal-based conversion of cellulose to obtain its maximum yield of 31.2%. The study also revealed that the plasma electrolysis of cellulose proceeds through novel radical-based mechanisms involving in situ-generated hydrogen radicals, by which cellulose depolymerizes and dehydrates much more efficiently than it does during conventional liquefaction. During the plasma electrolysis process, cellulose conversion was significantly enhanced by synergistic effects between Joule heating and plasma chemistry.

Corneal swabs yielded 465 bacterial isolates and 220 cultures (46.2%) with no apparent growth (0-5 isolates per culture). The most frequent bacterial genera were Staphylococcus (32.3%), Streptococcus (19.1%), and Pseudomonas (12.5%), while the most common bacterial species were Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (26.7%), Streptococcus canis (12%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%). Compared to mixed-breed dogs, canine breeds most likely to be examined for ulcerative keratitis included Boston terrier, Cavalier King Charles spaniel, miniature pinscher, pug, rat terrier, Saint Bernard, shih tzu, and silky terriers. In summer, the likelihood to yield a negative culture was reduced while the likelihood to culture Pseudomonas species was increased. Bacteria considered multidrug resistant (MDR, resistant to >= 3 antibiotic classes) represented 20% of all canine isolates and were most prevalent for Staphylococcus species (33%). An alarming, escalating trend of MDR prevalence was noted between 2016 (5%) and 2020 (34%). Individual ophthalmic preparations (i.e., single antibiotics or commercially available antibiotic combinations) with highest efficacy against all bacterial isolates included chloramphenicol (83%), ceftiofur (79%), amikacin (77%), neomycin-polymyxin B-bacitracin (77%), and gentamicin (74%). Efficacy of systemic antibiotics and combinations of ophthalmic preparations was also evaluated. Based on the present findings, triple antibiotic (Neo-Poly-Bac) is recommended as empirical monotherapy for prophylactic antibiotic therapy in dogs with simple corneal ulcers, while a chloramphenicol-ciprofloxacin combination is empirically recommended for therapeutic management of infected corneal ulcers. Pending culture and susceptibility results, appropriate selection of empiric antibiotic therapy is important to enhance therapeutic outcome and reduce antibacterial resistance in dogs with corneal ulceration.

Following the implementation of MAD in a country, analyst forecasts become more accurate, with relatively little of the effect attributable to increased voluntary public disclosure by covered firms. The effect of MAD on analyst accuracy is stronger in countries with more stringent enforcement and sanction systems. Although the improvement in accuracy is associated with the implementation of MAD alone, stock prices do not respond more strongly to analyst forecast releases until after market-trading enforcement improves under subsequent EU legislation (MiFID).

Statistical Insights Regarding Fully Softened Shear Strength	GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fully softened shear strength; Slope stability; Stiff fissured clays; Predictive model; Correlation analysis; Statistical insights	OPTIMIZATION	The fully softened shear strength (FSS) concept is a practical approximation of the mobilized drained shear strength of first-time slides in stiff-fissured clays. There has been a recent increase in interest in measurement and estimation ofFSSsecant friction angle (FSS-phi ' sec) to develop correlations for preliminary design and cost approximation. However, such correlations do not help in understanding the cause and effect relationship between soil properties andFSS-phi ' sec. In this study, a laboratory database containingFSS-phi ' secvalues (output) and soil properties (inputs) of several overconsolidated clays is used to develop a predictive model forFSS-phi ' sec(output or response). The goal is to detect which inputs from the whole parameter space dominate the response while creating an accurate prediction tool to provide statistical insights regarding theFSS-phi ' sec. The proposed methodology is used to assess and quantify the relationships among variables, estimate testing device effects onFSS-phi ' sec, and analyze the danger of extrapolation due to model constraints. The applicability of the predictedFSS-phi ' secis also evaluated and compared. Recommendations regarding the studied prediction tools for slope stability design in stiff-fissured clays are provided.

However, data are lacking on how the Shockwave compares to traditional aerification. The effects of hollow-tine (HT), solid-tine (ST), and Shockwave with a single pass (SW1) and perpendicular passes (SW2) were investigated and compared to an untreated control (C) for surface hardness, surface stability, soil moisture, water infiltration, percent green cover, and bulk density on established cultivar Rush Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) turf growing on native soil. Treatments were applied June-August with SW1 and SW2 receiving an additional treatment in September of each year. A modified Baldree traffic simulator was used to simulate 28 traffic events in the fall of each year. Data were analyzed using an exponential decay model, and the slope indicating cover loss event(-1) was used to compare treatments. In both years of the study, the HT (-0.031 in 2017 and -0.085 in 2018) treatment had the least green cover loss per event. The SW2 (-0.051) had the greatest cover loss event(-1) in 2017, while the C (-0.102) treatments experienced the largest cover loss event(-1) in 2018. In 2017 after 20 simulated traffic events, surface hardness on SW2 treatments were 30% lower than the highest surface hardness. After simulated traffic in 2018, SW1 treatments resulted in 10% lower surface hardness compared to the hardest surface, indicating the Shockwave can reduce surface hardness. This research indicates that the Shockwave could replace ST in maintaining athletic fields.

The Resistant Soybean-Aphis glycinesInteraction: Current Knowledge and Prospects	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Review						soybean; soybean aphids; biotypes; host plant resistance; Raggenes; gene pyramiding	HEMIPTERA APHIDIDAE; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; PLANT DEFENSE; SINGLE-GENE; IDENTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; CULTIVARS; LINES	Soybean aphids (Aphis glycinesMatsumura) are invasive insect pests of soybean, and they cause significant yield losses. Resistance to soybean aphids is conferred by Resistance toAphis glycines(Rag) genes. Since the first discovery of aphid-resistant soybean genotypes in 2004, several studies have attempted to characterizeRaggenes from aphid-resistant soybean genotypes. To date, 12Raggenes and four quantitative trait loci for aphid resistance have been reported on soybean chromosomes 07, 08, 13, 16, and 17. Although candidate genes have been proposed for several discoveredRagloci, additional studies are needed to pinpoint, validate, and further explain the potential mechanisms ofRaggene action. A major challenge to utilizing host plant resistance is the discovery of virulent aphid biotypes that can colonize aphid-resistant soybean. This occurrence suggests the need for additional studies to devise strategies to enhance the effectiveness of aphid-resistant soybean. In this mini review, we discuss current knowledge on the resistant soybean-Aphis glycinesinteraction, potential mechanisms ofRaggene action, opportunities to discover newRaggenes, and prospects for utilization of host plant resistance to manage soybean aphids. A clearer understanding of host plant resistance to soybean aphids will guide researchers on strategies for developing soybean varieties with more durable aphid resistance, reducing the present challenge of virulent aphid biotypes.

Cholinergic receptors on intestine cells of Ascaris suum and activation of nAChRs by levamisole	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-DRUGS AND DRUG RESISTANCE			English	Article						Levamisole; Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; Intestine; Calcium signaling	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; NEMATODE PARASITES; IDENTIFICATION; LUMBRICOIDES; PHARMACOLOGY; MEBENDAZOLE; INFECTIONS; CRY5B; MODE	Cholinergic agonists, like levamisole, are a major class of anthelmintic drugs that are known to act selectively on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the somatic muscle and nerves of nematode parasites to produce their contraction and spastic paralysis. Previous studies have suggested that in addition to the nAChRs found on muscle and nerves, there are nAChRs on non-excitable tissues of nematode parasites. We looked for evidence of nAChRs expression in the cells of the intestine of the large pig nematode, Ascaris suum, using RT-PCR and RNAscope in situ hybridization and detected mRNA of nAChR subunits in the cells. These subunits include components of the putative levamisole receptor in A. suum muscle: Asu-unc-38, Asu-unc-29, Asu-unc-63 and Asu-acr-8. Relative expression of these mRNAs in A. suum intestine was quantified by qPCR. We also looked for and found expression of G protein-linked acetylcholine receptors (Asu-gar-1). We used Fluo-3 AM to detect intracellular calcium changes in response to receptor activation by acetylcholine (as a non- selective agonist) and levamisole (as an L-type nAChR agonist) to look for evidence of functioning nAChRs in the intestine. We found that both acetylcholine and levamisole elicited increases in intracellular calcium but their signal profiles in isolated intestinal tissues were different, suggesting activation of different receptor sets. The levamisole responses were blocked by mecamylamine, a nicotinic receptor antagonist in A. suum, indicating the activation of intestinal nAChRs rather than G protein-linked acetylcholine receptors (GARs) by levamisole. The detection of nAChRs in cells of the intestine, in addition to those on muscles and nerves, reveals another site of action of the cholinergic anthelmintics and a site that may contribute to the synergistic interactions of cholinergic anthelmintics with other anthelmintics that affect the intestine (Cry5B).

The majority of these crashes occur on rural two-lane roadways, with a disproportionate number occurring on horizontal curves. The average crash rate for horizontal curves is about three times that of other highway segments. Curve-related crashes involve a number of roadway and driver causative factors, with speed being a preeminent factor. Implementing safety countermeasures on rural horizontal curves to address these crash types can improve the safety performance. Chevron alignment signs provide additional emphasis and guidance for drivers negotiating curves. To further emphasize the curve, some agencies have started using a sequential dynamic chevron warning system (SDCWS) which uses light emitting diode (LED) lights within each chevron sign to provide sequential lighted guidance through the curve. The research team evaluated 18 rural horizontal two-lane curves where a SDCWS had been implemented. Reference sites with similar characteristics were selected and included in the study. Models were developed using an empirical Bayes methodology for non-intersection (total) crashes and injury crashes. Additional countermeasures were present at some of the sites and were included in the model. Using these data, the study developed crash modification factors (CMFs) for SDCWS with a resulting CMF of 0.34 for total crashes (non-intersection) and 0.49 for injury crashes.

First, we outline the components of the "America First" nationalism of the Trump administration and identify some of its consequences for Canada and the larger global community. Next, we discuss how the "America First" approach is part of an emerging challenge to liberal democracy and to the long-standing liberal international order worldwide. With the increase in nationalism and populism globally and with the erosion of democratic commitment and practice by more and more states, Canada's traditional foreign policy of liberal internationalism is under increasing pressure to adapt and perhaps to change to maintain the global order. We have assembled a number of prominent scholars in this issue who offer important recommendations and prescriptions for the future direction of Canadian foreign policy.

Exploring the Potential of High-Resolution Satellite Imagery for the Detection of Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						soybean disease; sudden death syndrome; disease detection; remote sensing; PlanetScope; satellite imagery; random forest	SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; POWDERY MILDEW; PLANT; CLASSIFICATION; TREES	Sudden death syndrome (SDS) is one of the major yield-limiting soybean diseases in the Midwestern United States. Effective management for SDS requires accurate detection in soybean fields. Since traditional scouting methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often destructive, alternative methods to monitor SDS in large soybean fields are needed. This study explores the potential of using high-resolution (3 m) PlanetScope satellite imagery for detection of SDS using the random forest classification algorithm. Image data from blue, green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) spectral bands, the calculated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and crop rotation information were used to detect healthy and SDS-infected quadrats in a soybean field experiment with different rotation treatments, located in Boone County, Iowa. Datasets collected during the 2016, 2017, and 2018 soybean growing seasons were analyzed. The results indicate that spectral features, when combined with ground-based information, can detect areas in soybean plots that are at risk for disease, even before foliar symptoms develop. The classification of healthy and diseased soybean quadrats was >75% accurate and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was >70%. Our results indicate that high-resolution satellite imagery and random forest analyses have the potential to detect SDS in soybean fields, and that this approach may facilitate large-scale monitoring of SDS (and possibly other economically important soybean diseases). It may also be useful for guiding recommendations for site-specific management in current and future seasons.

Key to the analysis is the theoretical notion that effects are most pronounced for those who believe in the code intractably. We perform Latent Class Analysis to identify adherence types and use Latent Transition Analysis to measure the individual change in street-code class membership. Findings reveal four classes, distinguished mainly by the level of agreement. Those high and stable on the code are more likely to engage in crime and have diminished conflict management skills.

Detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-neutralizing antibody using high-throughput imaging cytometry	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATION			English	Article						imaging cytometry; neutralizing antibody; porcine epidemic diarrhea virus	SERUM; COLOSTRUM	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an emerging porcine coronavirus that causes a tremendous economic burden on the swine industry. The assessment of PEDV-neutralizing antibody levels provides a valuable tool to assess and predict herd immunity. We evaluated the performance of a PEDV imaging cytometry-based high-throughput neutralization test (HTNT) and compared the HTNT to a fluorescent focus neutralization (FFN) assay using serum samples from pigs of known PEDV infection status (n = 159). Estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for HTNT and FFN assays derived from receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses showed that both PEDV FFN and HTNT provided excellent diagnostic performance. However, in the laboratory, imaging cytometry provided an objective and semi-automated approach that removed human subjectivity from the testing process and reduced the read-time of a 96-well plate to < 4 min. In addition, imaging cytometry facilitated the rapid collection and long-term storage of test images and data for further evaluation or client consultation. For PEDV and other pathogens, imaging cytometry could provide distinct advantages over classic virus neutralization or FFN assays for the detection and quantitation of neutralizing antibody.

One reconstruction question is whether the blood has been spattered via gunshot or blunt impact such as beating or stabbing. This paper proposes an automated framework to classify bloodstain spatter patterns generated under controlled conditions into either gunshot or blunt impact classes. Classification is performed using machine learning. The study is performed with 94 blood spatter patterns which are available as public data sets, designs a set of features with possible relevance to classification, and uses the random forests method to rank the most useful features and perform classification. The study shows that classification accuracy decreases with the increasing distance between the target surface collecting the stains and the blood source. Based on the data set used in this study, the model achieves 99% accuracy in classifying spatter patterns at distances of 30 cm, 93% accuracy at distances of 60 cm, and 86% accuracy at distances of 120 cm. Results with 10 additional backspatter patterns also show that the presence of muzzle gases can reduce classification accuracy.

Furthermore, in order to identify whether the voltage stability limit is due to the transmission network or a distribution network, a transmission-distribution distinguishing index (TDDI) is proposed. The novelty in the proposed indices is that they can account for the unbalance in the lines and loads, enabling them to use unbalanced phasor measurements naturally. This is supported by mathematical derivations and numerical results. A convex optimization formulation to estimate the 3 phi Thevenin equivalent using PMU and mu PMU measurements is proposed, making it possible to calculate VSI and TDDI in an online model-free manner. Numerical simulations performed using co-simulation between Pypower and GridlabD are presented for the IEEE 9 bus and the 30 bus transmission networks combined with several modified IEEE 13 node and 37 node distribution networks. These case studies validate the proposed 3 phi-VSI and TDDI over a wide range of scenarios and demonstrate the importance of mu PMU measurements in identifying the regions causing long term voltage instability.

J.; Wannemuehler, Michael J.; Mellata, Melha			Mouse Genetic Background Affects Transfer of an Antibiotic Resistance Plasmid in the Gastrointestinal Tract	MSPHERE			English	Article						horizontal gene transfer; gut microbiota; plasmid; antibiotic resistance; altered Schaedler flora	ESCHERICHIA-COLI STRAINS; VIRULENCE PLASMIDS; GUT; MICROBIOTA; COMMENSAL; NETWORK; MICE; INFLAMMATION; DIVERSITY; INTESTINE	Dissemination of antibiotic resistance (AR) genes, often on plasmids, leads to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, which is a major problem for animal and public health. Bacterial conjugation is the primary route of AR gene transfer in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. Significant gaps in knowledge about which gastrointestinal communities and host factors promote plasmid transfer remain. Here, we used Salmonella enterica serovar Kentucky strain CVM29188 carrying plasmid pCVM29188_146 (harboring streptomycin and tetracycline resistance genes) to assess plasmid transfer to Escherichia coli under in vitro conditions and in various mouse strains with a conventional or defined microbiota. As an initial test, the transfer of pCVM29188_146 to the E. coli strains was confirmed in vitro. Colonization resistance and, therefore, a lack of plasmid transfer were found in wild-type mice harboring a conventional microbiota. Thus, mice harboring the altered Schaedler flora (ASF), or ASF mice, were used to probe for host factors in the context of a defined microbiota. To assess the influence of inflammation on plasmid transfer, we compared interleukin-10 gene-deficient 129S6/SvEv ASF mice (proinflammatory environment) to wild-type 129S6/SvEv ASF mice and found no difference in transconjugant yields. In contrast, the mouse strain influenced plasmid transfer, as C3H/HeN ASF mice had significantly lower levels of transconjugants than 129S6/SvEv ASF mice. Although gastrointestinal members were identical between the ASF mouse strains, a few differences from C3H/HeN ASF mice were detected, with C3H/HeN ASF mice having significantly lower abundances of ASF members 356 (Clostridium sp.), 492 (Eubacterium plexicaudatum), and 502 (Clostridium sp.) than 129S6/SvEv ASF mice. Overall, we demonstrate that microbiota complexity and mouse genetic background influence in vivo plasmid transfer. IMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance is a threat to public health. Many clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes are carried on plasmids that can be transferred to other bacterial members in the gastrointestinal tract. The current study used a murine model to study the transfer of a large antibiotic resistance plasmid from a foodborne Salmonella strain to a gut commensal E. coli strain in the gastrointestinal tract. We found that different mouse genetic backgrounds and a different diversity of microbial communities influenced the level of Escherichia coli that acquired the plasmid in the gastrointestinal tract. This study suggests that the complexity of the microbial community and host genetics influence plasmid transfer from donor to recipient bacteria.

Exotic species drive patterns of plant species diversity in 93 restored tallgrass prairies	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						grassland; invasive species; prairie; restoration; plants; tallgrass	BETA DIVERSITY; INTERANNUAL VARIATION; BIODIVERSITY; RESTORATION; ECOSYSTEM; RICHNESS; GRASSLANDS; ESTABLISHMENT; PRODUCTIVITY; COMMUNITIES	A primary goal of restoration ecology is to understand the factors that generate variability in species diversity and composition among restorations. Plant communities may assemble deterministically toward a common community type, or they may assemble stochastically, ending differently because of weather conditions during establishment, soil legacy effects, or exotic species propagule pressure. To test these alternative hypotheses, we sampled plant communities and soil at 93 randomly selected restored prairies distributed throughout Iowa, USA. Five remnant sites were sampled as a reference. We tested our hypotheses using multiple regressions and investigated the strength of direct and indirect effects on species diversity and richness using structural equation models. The prairie restorations were highly variable in their age, size, diversity, soil characteristics, and how they were managed post-seeding. The strongest predictor of plant species richness and diversity was the degree of invasion, as measured by the abundance of exotic species. Restorations planted with species-rich seed mixes had reduced exotic species abundance, which led indirectly to higher species richness of restorations. Sites with higher organic matter and a more linear shape had a direct positive effect on exotic abundance, which in turn decreased diversity. We found little support for deterministic assembly, and diversity did not increase with the age of planting. Our results indicate that restored prairie communities tend to assemble into states of high or low diversity, driven by invasion from exotic plant species. Management of exotic species is essential for maximizing species diversity in temperate grassland restorations.

To trace the shifting patterns of research topics in higher education studies during the past 20 years, we examined networks of the topical structures of ASHE conference papers and a subset of U.S. higher education journals. Topical and co-citation networks indicated that the field may be at a point of reconfiguration. We found shifts in terminology, frameworks, and methodologies related to increasingly disconnected topic clusters. Currently, the field seems capable of encompassing these distinctions through more independent discourse subcommunities.

Effect of the conditional scalar dissipation rate in the conditional moment closure	PHYSICS OF FLUIDS			English	Article							DIRECT NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS; LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; DIFFERENTIAL DIFFUSION; VELOCITY FLUCTUATIONS; TURBULENCE; MODEL; FLOW; EQUATIONS; GRADIENT	In the context of modeling turbulent scalar mixing using probability density function (PDF) methods, the treatment of molecular mixing is of paramount importance. The conditional moment closure (CMC) offers a high-fidelity description for molecular mixing in nonpremixed flows. Recent work has demonstrated that first-order CMC can be implemented numerically using the moments of the conditioning variable and first-order joint moments of the scalar of interest. When solving the CMC using, for example, quadrature-based moment methods (QBMM), a functional form must be chosen for the conditional scalar dissipation rate (CSDR) of the conditioning variable. In prior work, the CSDR was chosen to produce a beta -PDF for the conditioning variable (mixture fraction) at steady state. This choice has the advantage that the system of moment equations used in QBMM-CMC can be written in closed form. In this work, an alternative choice for the CSDR is investigated, namely, the amplitude mapping closure (AMC). With the AMC, the moment equations can be closed using the quadrature method of moments incorporated into a realizable ordinary differential equation solver. Results are compared with the beta -CSDR closure for binary, passive scalar mixing in homogeneous single- and disperse-phase turbulent flows. It is also demonstrated that the moment formulation of CMC provides a straightforward method for modeling the effect of differential diffusion in the context of CMC.

J	Saini, D; Shafei, B				Saini, Dikshant; Shafei, Behrouz			Performance of structural insulated panels with metal skins subjected to windborne debris impact	COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING			English	Article						Perforation resistance; Composite panels; Impact simulations; Windborne debris hazard	RESISTANCE; DESIGN; FOAMS	Structural insulated panels (SIPs), which consist of a composite of an insulating polymer foam sandwiched between two layers of structural skins, are widely used in residential and commercial buildings. Such panels, in the regions prone to hurricanes and tornadoes, are often exposed to the risk of windborne debris impact. Despite the consequences associated with damage to SIPs, the studies on their perforation resistance and design variables have been rather limited. To address this gap, the current study develops a computational framework to assess the vulnerability of the SIPs of various configurations subjected to a range of windborne debris impact scenarios. For this purpose, impact simulations are conducted to quantify the response and evaluate the extent of damage to the SIPs. The study is further extended to evaluate the effect of various structural details and material properties on the perforation resistance of the SIPs. Based on the simulation results, a set of vulnerability curves are developed to capture the risk of failure of the SIPs under the windborne debris hazard. This is expected to improve the design of this important category of wall panels, especially to ensure their safety and performance during severe windstorms.

Facilitating transfer through incorrect examples and explanatory feedback	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Correct and incorrect examples; complex concept learning; transfer; comprehension; explanatory feedback	HIGH-CONFIDENCE ERRORS; ERRONEOUS EXAMPLES; WORKED EXAMPLES; LEARNING FRACTIONS; SCHEMA ACQUISITION; PROVIDED EXAMPLES; PERFORMANCE; HYPERCORRECTION; CATEGORIZATION; SIMILARITY	This article examines whether studying correct versus incorrect examples produces differential learning. A prediction that follows from behaviourism is that learning should be best from studying correct examples. A contrasting prediction is that incorrect examples can highlight a concept's properties that are missing in the example, and thereby enable concept learning. We test these ideas across two experiments, wherein subjects were shown hypothetical study scenarios and were asked to determine whether each was a true experiment. In Experiment 1, some subjects were only presented correct examples, some were only presented incorrect examples, and others were presented both. In addition, example type was crossed with feedback type: Some subjects were givenexplanatory feedbackand some were not given any feedback; a control condition was also included, wherein subjects were not shown any study scenarios. All subjects completed a posttest involving novel scenarios; some questions asked subjects to indicate whether they were true experiments (classification questions), and some asked them to specify what was lacking in the design or to indicate how it could be fixed (application questions). Experiment 2 used a similar design, but compared explanatory feedback with corrective feedback. In both experiments, as long as some form of feedback was provided, subjects in the mixed example condition achieved the best classification performance. Furthermore, subjects in the incorrect and mixed example conditions performed best on application questions, particularly when explanatory feedback was provided. These findings offer insights into the mechanisms that might underlie learning from incorrect examples.

Thoracic ultrasound identified moderate pericardial perfusion. The doe expired during an emergency caesarean section. Necropsy revealed a 2.5-cm-long hypodermic needle fragment that had migrated from the reticulum to the pericardial cavity and ultimately to the omental fat. While not commonly described in small ruminants, practitioners should be aware of the potential for traumatic pericarditis in goats and, as such, should consider hardware disease a differential for goats with pericardial effusion.

J	Zheng, JX; He, HT; Alimohammadi, H				Zheng, Junxing; He, Hantao; Alimohammadi, Hossein			Three-dimensional Wadell roundness for particle angularity characterization of granular soils	ACTA GEOTECHNICA			English	Article						Computational geometry; Particle angularity; Particle shape characterization; Wadell roundness	PERMANENT DEFORMATION-BEHAVIOR; SHEAR-WAVE VELOCITY; AGGREGATE MORPHOLOGY; QUANTIFY AGGREGATE; SHAPE; SAND; STRENGTH; SPHERICITY; STRESS; SCALE	The geologist Hakon Wadell proposed the roundness definition in the 1930s for quantifying the particle angularity of granular soils. Due to the difficulty in obtaining three-dimensional (3D) particle geometries in the 1930s, Wadell used two-dimensional (2D) projections of particles to develop his roundness definition, although it is limited for analyzing 3D particles. This study shows that Wadell's 2D roundness could be extended to a 3D definition. The 3D roundness is defined as the ratio of the average radius of spheres fitting to corners and ridges of a 3D particle to the radius of the maximum inscribed sphere of the 3D particle. A computational geometry algorithm is proposed to automatically identify corners and ridges, fit appropriate spheres to corners and ridges, identify the maximum inscribed sphere of the 3D particle, and compute 3D roundness. The number of slices per diameter of the maximum inscribed sphere of the particle,NSD, is defined for controlling the sphere fitting process. The minimum requiredNSD = 300 is established to ensure the reliable use of the proposed 3D computational geometry algorithm. Finally, a total of 20,000 particles from five sand specimens with various angularities are scanned by X-ray computed tomography. The 2D and 3D roundnesses of these 20,000 particles are compared. The 2D roundnesses capture the general trend of the corresponding 3D roundnesses, but vary in a large range, resulting in significant uncertainties when using 2D images to infer 3D particle angularities.

J	Dziubanski, D; Franz, KJ; Gutowski, W				Dziubanski, David; Franz, Kristie J.; Gutowski, William			Linking economic and social factors to peak flows in an agricultural watershed using socio-hydrologic modeling	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							PRAIRIE FILTER STRIPS; AGENT-BASED MODELS; LAND-USE; FARMER IDENTITIES; RIVER-BASIN; CLIMATE; SIMULATION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; US	Hydrologic modeling studies most often represent humans through predefined actions and fail to account for human responses under changing hydrologic conditions. By treating both human and hydrologic systems as coevolving, we build a socio-hydrological model that combines an agent-based model (ABM) with a semi-distributed hydrologic model. The curve number method is used to clearly illustrate the impacts of land cover changes resulting from decisions made by two different agent types Aiming to reduce flooding, a city agent pays farmer agents to convert land into conservation. Farmer agents decide how to allocate land between conservation and production based on factors related to profits, past land use, and willingness. The model is implemented for a watershed representative of the mixed agricultural/small urban area land use found in Iowa, USA. In this preliminary study, we simulate scenarios of crop yields, crop prices, and conservation subsidies along with varied farmer parameters that illustrate the effects of human system variables on peak discharges. High corn prices lead to a decrease in conservation land from historical levels; consequently, mean peak discharge increases by 6 %, creating greater potential for downstream flooding within the watershed. However, when corn prices are low and the watershed is characterized by a conservation-minded farmer population, mean peak discharge is reduced by 3 %. Overall, changes in mean peak discharge, which is representative of farmer land use decisions, are most sensitive to changes in crop prices as opposed to yields or conservation subsidies.

J	Gao, YJ				Gao, Yijin			Knowledge Diffusion and economic Growth based on Fourier's law	RESEARCH IN ECONOMICS			English	Article						Knowledge diffusion; Economic growth; Fourier's law; Finite difference method; Partial differential equation		Learning is the basic thing for a person's growth, whenever in school or on the work. Also the economic growth of a country depends its technology and science. The knowledge diffusion in a firm dynamic system is important. Some former models have been given by Fernando E. Alvarez, Francisco J. Buera and Robert E. Lucas, Jr's paper: "Models of Idea Flows"(Alvarez et al., 2008). Our model based on the earlier work but extend the definition of spread direction based on Fourier's law, in which case can also explain the asymptotic equilibrium state. Solving the partial differential equation helps us to learn the solution well. A simulation is given using finite difference method to sketch the curve moving, also comparing with the realistic economic curves and they are fit. It can well explain the economic stable in the closed system of a single country and a "huge" change under some special outside "source" power. (c) 2020 University of Venice.

Lotus-leaf-inspired superhydrophobic surfaces (SHS) and 2). Pitcher-plant-inspired slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) for aircraft icing mitigation. By leveraging the unique Icing Research Tunnel of Iowa State University (i.e., ISU-IRT), an experimental campaign was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of using SHS and SLIPS coatings to suppress impact ice accretion over the surfaces of typical airfoil/wing models. While both SHS and SLIPS were found to be able to suppress ice accretion over the airframe surfaces where strong aerodynamic forces are exerted, ice was still found to accrete in the vicinity of the airfoil stagnation line where the aerodynamic forces are at their minimum. A novel hybrid anti-/de-icing strategy concept to combine icephobic coatings with minimized surface heating near airfoil leading edge was demonstrated to effectively remove impact ice accretion over entire airfoil/wing surfaces. An experimental investigation was also conducted to examine the durability of the icephobic coatings/surfaces to resist "rain erosion" effects (i.e., the damage to the surface coatings due to continuous impingement of water droplets at high speeds) in considering the practical usage for aircraft icing mitigation. The rain erosion effects were characterized based on the variations of the ice adhesion strengths and surface morphology of the eroded test surfaces coated with SHS and SLIPS. The research findings are very helpful to elucidate the underlying physics for the development of novel and robust anti-/de-icing strategies for aircraft icing mitigation.

MYO, a Candidate Gene for Haploid Induction in Maize Causes Male Sterility	PLANTS-BASEL			English	Article						haploid induction; maize; male sterility; myosin; RNAi; transgenic; Zea mays	GENOME; PHOSPHOLIPASE; GYNOGENESIS; LINES	Doubled haploid technology is highly successful in maize breeding programs and is contingent on the ability of maize inducers to efficiently produce haploids. Knowledge of the genes involved in haploid induction is important for not only developing better maize inducers, but also to create inducers in other crops. The main quantitative trait loci involved in maize haploid induction areqhir1andqhir8. The gene underlyingqhir1has been discovered and validated by independent research groups. Prior to initiation of this study, the gene associated withqhir8had yet to be recognized. Therefore, this research focused on characterizing positional candidate genes underlyingqhir8. Pursuing this goal, a strong candidate forqhir8,GRMZM2G435294(MYO), was silenced by RNAi. Analysis of crosses with these heterozygous RNAi-transgenic lines for haploid induction rate revealed that the silencing ofMYOsignificantly enhanced haploid induction rate by an average of 0.6% in the presence ofqhir1. Recently,GRMZM2G465053(ZmDMP) was identified by map-based gene isolation and shown to be responsible forqhir8. While our results suggest thatMYOmay contribute to haploid induction rate, results were inconsistent and only showing minor increases in haploid induction rate compared toZmDMP. Instead, reciprocal crosses clearly revealed that the silencing ofMYOcauses male sterility.

The present research addresses the need to develop and conceptualize open pedagogy models in higher education contexts. This case study examined student perspectives on the affordances, challenges, and impact of an open pedagogy approach implemented within the context of three higher education courses. Various renewable assignments were integrated into face-to-face, blended, and online courses. Data sources consisted of reflection reports and semi-structured interviews conducted with 13 student participants. The qualitative analysis revealed six themes that conceptualized student engagement with open pedagogy: content curation, peer feedback, community engagement, development, reflection, and scaffolding. We discuss the impact of these practices on the participating students' knowledge and awareness of open access and student agency. The results present an open pedagogy in action model with recommendations for future research and practice.

A Retrospective Clinical Investigation of the Safety and Adverse Effects of Pantoprazole in Hospitalized Ruminants	FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE			English	Article						pantoprazole; ruminant; cattle; bovine; goats; caprine; sheep; ovine	PHARMACOKINETICS	Clinical safety data for the use of gastroprotectants in hospitalized ruminants is lacking. In human patients, multiple adverse effects are possible from the use of pantoprazole including hematologic and electrolyte abnormalities as well as anaphylaxis and edema. The medical records of all hospitalized cattle, goats, and sheep administered pantoprazole over an similar to 5-year period were retrospectively analyzed for adverse effects. Seventy-nine eligible patients were observed. Hypomagnesemia was observed after pantoprazole administration in 10 cattle; however, no significant changes were noted when compared to baseline before pantoprazole administration. Significant changes were noted in serum indicators of hepatic and renal function; however, these represented downward trends that were most likely clinically insignificant. Anaphylaxis after pantoprazole administration was not observed; however, seven cattle displayed edema after pantoprazole administration. Veterinary clinicians should be aware of the potential for hypomagnesemia in hospitalized ruminants being administered pantoprazole and monitor patients accordingly. While these preliminary retrospective results indicate that pantoprazole may be a safe adjunctive therapy in hospitalized ruminants, additional studies are necessary to further determine the safety and toxicity of pantoprazole in ruminants.

J	Gao, LY; Liu, Y; Hu, H				Gao, Linyue; Liu, Yang; Hu, Hui			An experimental investigation on the dynamic glaze ice accretion process over a wind turbine airfoil surface	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER			English	Article						Ice accretion process; Water transport behavior; Wind turbine icing; Glaze ice; Digital Image Projection (DIP) technique	MODEL; ISSUES	Icing events, particularly under precipitation-icing conditions in which high-liquidity glaze ice tends to form, could pose significant threats to the safe and effective operations of wind turbines in cold and wet environments. During the glaze ice accretion process, the wind-driven unfrozen water was coupled with the growth of ice structures and difficult to be quantified and characterized. In the present study, we introduced a Digital Image Projection (DIP) technique to quantitatively measure the unsteady water runback behaviors and dynamic ice accretion process under typical glaze icing conditions over a highly-cambered wind turbine airfoil surface, i.e., the pressure-side surface of DU91-W2-250 airfoil, in the Icing Research Tunnel at Iowa State University (ISU-IRT). DIP measurement results were found to be able to successfully capture the time-resolved three-dimensional information of the water transport behaviors over the ice accreting surface of the airfoil model during the glaze icing processes. The stumbling motions of the rivulet flows were observed during the icing processes, coupled with an increasing fluctuations induced by the underneath ice roughness. The forces acting on the rivulet flows were analyzed, and a theoretical model based on the force balance was built to predict the rivulet flows. The effects of the incoming airflow velocity on the glaze icing process over the airfoil surface were also studied, and it was found that, as the incoming flow velocity increased, the runback rivulet flows would move farther downstream and became thinner and narrower due to the increased aerodynamic stress acting on them. The rivulet bulged shape was found to have an inverse relationship with the inflow velocity squared. In addition, the ice accreted over the airfoil surface during an icing process was quantitatively decoupled from the unfrozen wind-driven water, and the quantitative results can be used to validate and optimize current ice accretion models.

Selective hybridization and capture of KRAS DNA from plasma and blood using ion-tagged oligonucleotide probes coupled to magnetic ionic liquids	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						DNA extraction; Cell-free DNA; PCR; Ionic liquid; Magnetic separation	TUMOR DNA; CELL-FREE; PCR; EXTRACTION; MUTATIONS; QUANTIFICATION; SENSITIVITY; INHIBITORS; BIOTIN; ALLELE	Detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) presents several challenges due to single-nucleotide poly-morphisms and large amounts of background DNA. Previously, we reported a sequence-specific DNA extraction procedure utilizing functionalized oligonucleotides called ion-tagged oligonucleotides (ITOs) and disubstituted ion-tagged oligonucleotides (DTOs). ITOs and DTOs are capable of hybridizing to complementary DNA for subsequent capture by a magnetic ionic liquid (MIL) through hydrophobic interactions, pi-pi stacking, and fluorophilic interactions. However, the performance of the ITOs and DTOs in complex sample matrices has not yet been evaluated. In this study, we compare the amount of KRAS DNA extracted using ITO and DTOs from saline, 2-fold diluted plasma, 10-fold diluted plasma, and 10-fold diluted blood. We demonstrate that ITO/DTO-MIL extraction is capable of selectively preconcentrating DNA from diluted plasma and blood without additional sample preparation steps. In comparison, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were unable to selectively extract DNA from 10-fold diluted plasma and 10-fold diluted blood without additional sample clean-up steps. Significantly more DNA could be extracted from 2-fold diluted plasma and 10-fold diluted blood matrices using the DTO probes compared to the ITO probes, likely due to stronger interactions between the probe and MIL. The ability of the DTO-MIL method to selectively preconcentrate small concentrations of DNA from complex biological matrices suggests that this method could be beneficial for ctDNA analysis.

The standard device model using a constant range (mu tau F) where F is the electric field had to be modified to account for the field variation when interpreting QE vs. voltage data to deduce (mu tau) product. The as-grown material is generally n-type with doping in the 10(15)/cm(3) range. Heterojunction devices were made on FTO coated glass substrates using n-CdS as the n-heterojunction layer and organic materials such as PTAA, P3HT and PEDOT:PSS as the p-type heterojunction layer. Urbach energy of tail states was measured using subgap quantum efficiency and was found to be 15 meV.

Our research is centered on the revolutionary hip-hop fashion movement in Black history as it relates to Black millennials' experiences of fashioning their bodies. We examine the perception of Black millennials who are attending or have attended historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU) and their knowledge and perceptions of prominent Black-owned, urban fashion brands that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s. Additionally, we seek to understand how or if these brands influence Black millennial consumers and their stylistic choices today. We used a qualitative approach and conducted 14 in-depth, semistructured interviews. Based on analysis of the data, we identified four themes: awareness of urban styles; ambiguous perceptions; 1980s and 1990s urban style influence; and awareness of cultural appropriation. We offer implications to the apparel industry.

Considering policy domains together provides insight into how different policy decisions interact. The model incorporates important characteristics of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, such as heterogeneous risk factors and asymptomatic transmission, and enables a reliable qualitative comparison of policy choices despite the current uncertainty in key virus and disease parameters. Results suggest possible refinements to current policies, including emphasizing the need to reduce random encounters more than personal contacts, and testing low-risk symptomatic individuals before high-risk symptomatic individuals. The strength of social distancing of symptomatic individuals affects the degree to which asymptomatic cases drive the epidemic as well as the level of population-wide contact reduction needed to keep hospitals below capacity. The relative importance of testing and triaging also depends on the overall level of social distancing.

The method uses persistence diagrams and bottleneck distances to identify anomalies. Specifically, we generate multiple predictors by randomly bagging the data (reference bags), then for each data point replacing the data point for a randomly chosen point in each bag (modified bags). The predictors then are the set of bottleneck distances for the reference/modified bag pairs. We prove the stability of the predictors as the number of bags increases. We apply our methodology to traffic data and measure the performance for identifying known incidents.

According to the neutrality problem, contrasting supervenience-based formulations of these positions cannot be neutral with respect to certain unrelated metaphysical commitments. According to the collapse problem, emergent properties can be accounted for using an appropriately expansive physical ontology, rendering strong emergentism metaphysically suspect. I argue that both these problems can be solved with a principled distinction between emergent causal laws and physical laws. I propose such a distinction based on a finite discontinuity in the behavior of fundamental physical constituents as a function of complexity.

However, the exact mechanism of stress development is yet to be elucidated. In the present study, multiscale computational models based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are applied to study the mechanism governing surface stress change. Distinct mechanisms for adsorption-induced surface deformation, namely, interchain repulsion and thiol-gold interaction-driven gold surface reconstruction, are investigated. Two different interatomic potentials, embedded atom method and surface-embedded atom method (SEAM), are used in the MD simulations to study the reconstruction-induced surface stresses. Comparison of the predicted surface stress changes, resulting from MD and continuum mechanics-based models, with the observed experimental response indicates that a modified SEAM-based multiscale model can better capture the surface stress changes observed during alkanethiol SAM formation, and gold surface reconstruction is the primary factor behind the surface stress change. The interchain repulsions of SAM are found to have a minimal contribution. Also, both the simulations and experiments show that the surface stress change increases with the increase of surface coverage density and larger grain size.

Water quality performance of wetlands receiving nonpoint-source nitrogen loads: Nitrate and total nitrogen removal efficiency and controlling factors	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; RIVER-BASIN; RETENTION	Nonpoint-source nitrogen (N) loads in the U.S. Corn Belt are a major concern both for local impacts on receiving waters and for contributing to hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Nonpoint-source nutrient loads can be ameliorated by a combination of in-field and offsite practices, and wetland restoration is a particularly promising approach for reducing N loads from agricultural drainage. However, there is considerable variability among wetlands, and adequate performance data are available for relatively few systems receiving unregulated nonpoint-source loads. We measured N mass balances of 26 restored wetlands receiving a wide range of unregulated, naturally varying hydraulic and nutrient loads to evaluate the N removal performance of these systems and the effects of major factors controlling their performance. Nitrogen loads were primarily in the form of nitrate, and all of the wetlands were effective in reducing both nitrate and total N loads. Nitrate N and total N removal rates averaged 1,500 and 1,440 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, with the slightly lower total N removal rates reflecting a small net export of reduced N (averaging 66 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). Average nitrate and total N removal rates were substantially higher than typically reported for Corn Belt wetlands but comparable with highly loaded systems elsewhere. Nitrate removal efficiency ranged from 9 to 92% and was strongly related to hydraulic loading rate and temperature. Results demonstrate the substantial capacity of wetlands to reduce unregulated and highly variable nonpoint-source N loads over a broad range of weather and loading conditions and provide a reasonable basis for predicting average wetland performance based on hydraulic loading rate, temperature, and nitrate concentration.

J	Shen, S; Sadoughi, M; Li, M; Wang, ZD; Hu, C				Shen, Sheng; Sadoughi, Mohammadkazem; Li, Meng; Wang, Zhengdao; Hu, Chao			Deep convolutional neural networks with ensemble learning and transfer learning for capacity estimation of lithium-ion batteries	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Capacity estimation; Transfer learning; Ensemble learning; Lithium-ion batteries	SOLID-ELECTROLYTE INTERPHASE; ELECTRIC VEHICLE-BATTERIES; REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; MODEL; STATE; MACHINE; PREDICTION; REGRESSION; SOC	It is often difficult for a machine learning model trained based on a small size of charge/discharge cycling data to produce satisfactory accuracy in the capacity estimation of lithium-ion (Li-ion) rechargeable batteries. However, in real-world applications, collecting long-term cycling data is a costly and time-consuming process. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a deep learning-based capacity estimation method that incorporates the concepts of transfer learning and ensemble learning. We target the applications where only a relatively small set of training data is available. Transfer learning is a knowledge learning method that leverages the knowledge learned from a source task to improve learning in a related but different target task. Ensemble learning can reduce the risk of choosing a learning algorithm with poor performance by combining prediction results from multiple learning algorithms. In this study, 10-year daily cycling data from eight implantable Li-ion cells is first used as the source dataset to pre-train eight deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models. The learned parameters of the pre-trained DCNN models are then transferred from the source task to the target task, resulting in eight DCNN with transfer learning (DCNN-TL) models, respectively. These DCNN-TL models are then integrated to build an ensemble model called the DCNN with ensemble learning and transfer learning (DCNN-ETL). The effectiveness of the DCNN-ETL model is verified using a target dataset consisting of 20 commercial 18650 Li-ion cells, and the performance of the model on the target dataset is compared with that of five other data-driven methods including random forest regression, Gaussian process regression, DCNN, DCNN-TL, and DCNN-EL. The verification and comparison results demonstrate that the proposed DCNN-ETL method can produce a higher accuracy and robustness than these other data-driven methods in estimating the capacities of the Li-ion cells in the target task.

In light of this, we synthesized literature data and used the APSIM software to enhance the modeling capacity to simulate plant growth, development, and N fixation response to flooding. Literature data included greenhouse and field experiments from across the U.S. that investigated the impact of flood timing and duration on soybean. Five datasets were used for model parameterization of new functions and three datasets were used for testing. Improvements in prediction accuracy were quantified by comparing model performance before and after the implementation of new stage-dependent excess water functions for phenology, photosynthesis and N-fixation. The relative root mean square error (RRMSE) for yield predictions improved by 26% and the RRMSE predictions of biomass improved by 40%. Extensive model testing found that the improved model accurately simulates plant responses to flooding including how these responses change with flood timing and duration. When used to project soybean response to future climate scenarios, the model showed that intense rain events had a greater negative effect on yield than a 25% increase in rainfall distributed over 1 or 3 month(s). These developments advance our ability to understand, predict and, thereby, mitigate yield loss as increases in climatic volatility lead to more frequent and intense flooding events in the future.

In yeast, the COPII machinery is critical for cell viability as most COPII knockout mutants fail to survive. In mice and fish, homozygous knockout mutants of most COPII genes are embryonic lethal, reflecting the essentiality of the COPII machinery in the early stages of vertebrate development. In humans, COPII mutations, which are often hypomorphic, cause diseases having distinct clinical features. This is interesting as the fundamental cellular defect of these diseases, that is, failure of ER export, is similar. Analyses of humans and animals carrying COPII mutations have revealed clues to why a similar ER export defect can cause such different diseases. Previous reviews have focused mainly on the deficit of secretory or membrane proteins in the final destinations because of an ER export block. In this review, we also underscore the other consequence of the ER export block, namely ER stress triggered by the accumulation of cargo proteins in the ER.

This paper places particular focus on the often-ignored last step of deployment. Our first phase of solution development involved data preparation, model selection, model training, and model validation. Given the necessarily small-scale nature of construction vehicle image datasets, we propose as detection model an improved version of the single shot detector MobileNet, which is suitable for embedded devices. Our study's second phase comprised model optimization, application-specific embedded system selection, economic analysis, and field implementation. Several embedded devices were proposed and compared. Results including a consistent above 90% mean average precision confirm the superior real-time performance of our proposed solutions. Finally, the practical field implementation of our proposed solutions was investigated. This study validates the practicality of deep-learning-based object detection solutions for construction scenarios. Moreover, the detailed information provided by the current study can be employed for several purposes such as safety monitoring, productivity assessments, and managerial decision making.

Acoustophoretic assembly of millimeter-scale Janus fibers	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; PARTICLES; FABRICATION; MANIPULATION; SUSPENSIONS; COMPOSITES; VISCOSITY; MICRO	This article presents a method for the assembly of millimeter-scale Janus fibers using acoustophoresis as an assembly mechanism. An acoustic flow cell mounted to a 3D printer combines acoustophoresis and additive manufacturing in a unique approach that allows for the assembly of textured Janus fibers. A dispersion consisting of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) filler particles in a UV curable polymer resin is passed through an acoustically excited capillary tube. To fundamentally understand this process, we develop a suspension balance model that accounts for acoustophoresis and concentration-driven shear-induced diffusion. Once assembled, the particle-polymer dispersion is cured using UV illumination to create a polymer composite fiber with particles immobilized on one side in a Janus-like configuration. The Janus fiber is observed to modify the light transmission profile when rotated on an optical microscope stage. Tensile measurements of the fiber show that the Young's modulus of the Janus fiber (50.5 MPa) is approximately twice that of a fiber fabricated from the polymer alone (24.7 MPa). The process we describe here could serve as a pathway for the fabrication of a variety of functional Janus fibers with possible applications to wearable textiles, soft robotics or surgical sutures.

I find that multiple opinions are more likely to be used in deals in which management/investment bank conflicts of interest are high-e.g., buyouts and stapled financing deals. In addition, the use of a second opinion has a significantly positive impact on target shareholders' wealth in these two types of deals. Fairness opinion valuation predominantly relies on accounting data, and the benefit of seeking a second opinion increases with a firm's earnings quality. Collectively, the results suggest that a second opinion is used to facilitate transactions.

The MAP test, which minimizes the average probability of detection error, exploits the noisy (erroneous) information about the true packet that the destination receives (overhears) directly from the source nodes as a reference. We show that the average probability of detection error decreases exponentially as the number of source nodes increases, regardless of the reliability of the reference information. This indicates that the multiplicity of source nodes can be leveraged to construct a powerful integrity check mechanism for detecting false data at the destination. We also present a parallel MAP test that improves the detection accuracy when the number of source nodes is limited and overhearing channel disparities are high. Then, we present a packet recovery mechanism to recover false alarmed packets, i.e. unmodified packets that are mistakenly declared as modified, by the MAP test and thereby to improve the throughput.

In the last decade, the advances of X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) techniques enabled researchers to capture three-dimensional (3D) volumetric images of soils, in which contacts can be observed. Many researchers have used a 3D image processing technique, called watershed analysis, to identify contacts in 3D volumetric images of soils. However, the watershed analysis cannot discriminate contacting particles and peanut-shaped particles, resulting in oversegmentation of peanut-shaped particles. This research developed an improved watershed analysis to solve this issue. The proposed algorithm was validated using a crushed limestone specimen, which contains many elongated and peanut-shaped particles. The results showed that the improve watershed analysis can accurately identify all the contacts in this challenging soil specimen.

We identify critical thresholds in two damped Euler-Poisson systems, with and without alignment, both with attractive potential and spatially variable background state. For both systems, we give respective bounds for subcritical and supercritical regions in the space of initial configuration, thereby proving the existence of a critical threshold for each scenario.

However, few soil water potential sensors are available to conduct long-term, continuous measurements with full automation, due to cavitation formation inside the sensors while interacting with the soil. This paper presents a miniature, field-deployable soil water potential sensor capable of real-time measurement with a wide dynamic range from 0 to -800 kPa, a minimum detectable change of water potential of similar to 40 Pa, and a high sensitivity of similar to 0.248 mu A/kPa. The sensor consists of a shallow water reservoir sandwiched between a nanoporous ceramic plate and a thin silicon diaphragm with thermal oxide. The nanoscale pores of the ceramic plate allow for the increase of air entry tension, while the smooth and hydrophilic interior surfaces of the water reservoir help to minimize the trapping of air bubbles in the reservoir. When the sensor is embedded in unsaturated soils, the pre-filled water in the reservoir tends to leave the reservoir through the nanopores of the ceramic plate, until an equilibrium in water potential is achieved between the reservoir and the soil. The loss of water leads to bending of the silicon-based diaphragm toward the reservoir. The displacement of the diaphragm is quantified by a miniature optical displacement detector assembled with the sensor, which corresponds to the soil water potential. The presented soil sensor has been validated through both greenhouse and field experiments to monitor dynamic changes in soil water potential in real-time over multiple days.

The advantages of the radially polarized antenna, mainly that polarimetric SAR imaging can be performed without requiring additional measurements compared to traditional SAR, are discussed. A general target model is developed that includes information about target orientation and degree of polarization (i.e., how well and in what direction the target polarizes a signal). Image reconstruction algorithms were developed to allow polarimetric imaging to be performed with radially polarized antenna imaging data, enabling the estimation of target orientation and degree of polarization. The effect of scan step size and scan aperture size is studied on the accuracy of the estimation of these parameters, and guidelines were established as to the proper step size and scan aperture size to be used to keep estimation error below a specific threshold. Subsequently, a radially polarized antenna was designed, fabricated, and used to image several samples containing various types of point targets, by which the capability of this technique to enable accurate estimation of target orientation and degree of polarization is successfully demonstrated.

J	Brown, RC				Brown, Robert C.			Process Intensification through Directly Coupled Autothermal Operation of Chemical Reactors	JOULE			English	Review								Autothermal operation of a chemical reactor involves coupling exothermic and endothermic chemical reactions for the purpose of thermal management without resorting to external energy sinks or sources. Often this is accomplished through regenerative or recuperative heat exchange between spatially or temporally separated exothermic and endothermic reactions. However, it is also possible to directly couple these reactions simultaneously within the same reactor volume, eliminating the heat-transfer bottleneck that characterizes much of chemical manufacture. It is not widely recognized that directly coupled autothermal operation allows dramatic process intensification. This perspective defines autothermal operation and contrasts it with conventional heat transfer for thermal management of chemical processes. The intensification and cost savings that can be achieved are quantified, and the implications to modular chemical process intensification are presented. Guidelines are proposed for designing directly coupled autothermal processes. Diverse examples are presented. Several challenges to expanding the field are critically discussed.

Whole egg consumption increases gene expression within the glutathione pathway in the liver of Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OXIDATIVE STRESS; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; GUT MICROBIOME; DIET; METABOLISM; INSULIN; PEOPLE; RISK; MELLITUS	Nutrigenomic evidence supports the idea that Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) arises due to the interactions between the transcriptome, individual genetic profiles, lifestyle, and diet. Since eggs are a nutrient dense food containing bioactive ingredients that modify gene expression, our goal was to examine the role of whole egg consumption on the transcriptome during T2DM. We analyzed whether whole egg consumption in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats alters microRNA and mRNA expression across the adipose, liver, kidney, and prefrontal cortex tissue. Male ZDF (fa/fa) rats (n = 12) and their lean controls (fa/+) (n = 12) were obtained at 6 wk of age. Rats had ad libitum access to water and were randomly assigned to a modified semi-purified AIN93G casein-based diet or a whole egg-based diet, both providing 20% protein (w/w). TotalRNA libraries were prepared using QuantSeq 3' mRNA-Seq and Lexogen smallRNA library prep kits and were further sequenced on an Illumina HighSeq3000. Differential gene expression was conducted using DESeq2 in R and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P-values controlling for false discovery rate at 5%. We identified 9 microRNAs and 583 genes that were differentially expressed in response to 8 wk of consuming whole egg-based diets. Kyto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes/Gene ontology pathway analyses demonstrated that 12 genes in the glutathione metabolism pathway were upregulated in the liver and kidney of ZDF rats fed whole egg. Whole egg consumption primarily altered glutathione pathways such as conjugation, methylation, glucuronidation, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species. These pathways are often negatively affected during T2DM, therefore this data provides unique insight into the nutrigenomic response of dietary whole egg consumption during the progression of T2DM.

J	Kordbacheh, F; Liebman, M; Harris, M				Kordbacheh, Farnaz; Liebman, Matt; Harris, Mary			Strips of prairie vegetation placed within row crops can sustain native bee communities	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FLORAL RESOURCES; FILTER STRIPS; DIVERSITY; HYMENOPTERA; POLLINATION; LANDSCAPE; BIODIVERSITY; RESTORATION; NETWORKS; PLANTS	As landscapes have become increasingly dominated by intensive agricultural production, plant diversity has declined steeply along with communities of pollinating insects including bees. Semi-natural habitats, such as field edge meadows and hedgerows, can be maintained to provide a diversity of flowering plants that can increase floral resources required by bees. An additional habitat enhancement practice is that of sowing strips of native prairie vegetation within row-cropped fields. In this study, conducted in Iowa, USA, we found that increases in both the abundance and diversity of floral resources in strips of native prairie vegetation within agricultural production fields greatly and positively influenced the bee community. The benefits to the bee community were important for both common and uncommon species and the effect may be strongest early in the season. Using networks of co-occurrence between plant and bee species, we were able to identify two native prairie plants, Ratibida pinnata and Zizia aurea, as potentially keystone resources that can be used to support native bees. When we evaluated the effect of reconstructed prairie strips on bees in the context of the surrounding landscape, we found that these conservation practices had positive effects on bees in agriculturally-dominated areas and that these effects were detectable in low to high complexity landscapes with 8-69% natural habitat. In landscapes dominated by crops with few pollen and nectar resources the inclusion of native prairie strips can buffer the decline of bees and effectively increase bee abundance and diversity.

J	Tuchin, K				Tuchin, Kirill			Anomalous scattering and transport in chiral matter	PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article							QCD	Chiral anomaly modifies the scattering processes in chiral systems. These processes can be investigated using the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory that couples electrodynamics to the pseudoscalar field theta describing the topological charge induced by external sources. Assuming slow variation of the topological charge density, the fermion scattering cross section is computed in the Born approximation and is found to have a resonance at the scattering angles proportional to the chiral conductivity. As a result, the transport coefficients are suppressed at high temperatures, which may be a reason for the smallness of the Quark Gluon Plasma viscosity. The anisotropy of the cross section arises due to the spatial variation of the topological charge; its effect on the electrical conductivity is discussed. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

We prove that if u is an alternating sequence abab . . . of length s, then Ex(u, j, n) = Theta(sn(2)) for all j >= 2 and s >= n, answering a question of Wellman and Pettie (2018) and extending the result of Roselle and Stanton that Ex(u, 2, n) = Theta(sn(2)) for any alternation u of length s >= n (Roselle and Stanton, 1971). Wellman and Pettie also asked how large must s(n) be for there to exist n-block DS(n, s(n)) sequences of length Omega(n(2-o(1))). We answer this question by showing that the maximum possible length of an n-block DS(n, s(n)) sequence is Omega(n(2-o(1))) if and only if s(n) = Omega(n(1-o(1))) . We also show related results for extremal functions of forbidden 0-1 matrices with any constant number of rows and extremal functions of forbidden sequences with any constant number of distinct letters.

Humans carry another nearly identical gene,SMN2, which mostly produces a truncated and less stable protein SMN Delta 7 due to predominant skipping of exon 7. Elevation of SMN upon correction ofSMN2exon 7 splicing and gene therapy have been proven to be the effective treatment strategies for SMA. Areas covered This review summarizes existing and potential SMA therapies that are based on RNA targeting.We also discuss the mechanistic basis of RNA-targeting molecules. Expert opinion The discovery of intronic splicing silencer N1 (ISS-N1) was the first major step towards developing the currently approved antisense-oligonucleotide (ASO)-directed therapy (SpinrazaTM) based on the correction of exon 7 splicing of the endogenous SMN2pre-mRNA. Recently, gene therapy (Zolgensma) has become the second approved treatment for SMA. Small compounds (currently in clinical trials) capable of restoring SMN2 exon 7 inclusion further expand the class of the RNA targeting molecules for SMA therapy. Endogenous RNA targets, such as long non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs, microRNAs and ribonucleoproteins, could be potentially exploited for developing additional SMA therapies.

J	Zhang, N; Alipour, A				Zhang, Ning; Alipour, Alice			Multi-scale robustness model for highway networks under flood events	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Flood hazard and risks; Transportation operation; Network robustness; User costs	SEISMIC RESILIENCE; TRANSPORT; VULNERABILITY; ENHANCE; WEATHER; IMPACT	Transportation system infrastructure often experiences severe flood-related disruptions such as overtopping, erosion, and scour. The ensuing damages can result in enormous direct and indirect economic losses to the traffic network and consequently the individuals through conditions like inaccessibility to commuters and reduction in traffic safety. Many studies have claimed that a robust transportation system could significantly prevent such consequences from natural hazards such as floods, highlighting the importance of robustness measures that could be used by decision-makers to properly manage flooded transportation system. Most available measures related to network robustness assessment are qualitative, and while some recent studies have focused on such evaluation using quantitative assessment approaches related to environmental or social-economic operations, they lack the holistic view towards robustness under flood events. This study develops a composite multi-scale transportation-system robustness model considering flood hazards by synthesizing geographical damage recognition, topological functionality analysis, network operation evaluation, and traffic-user loss estimation. This integrated model has been applied in a real-world highway network, mainly revealing that a given intensive flood occurrence at different locations may result in a variety of after-flood disruptions in the transportation network. To assist the asset owners with developing more reasonable prevention and recovery plans, the developed multi-scale robustness index presents both visible multi-denominational flood consequences and an overall post-event transportation-system robustness indicator.

J	He, X				He Xi			US agricultural exports and labor market adjustments	AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						farm and nonfarm employment; labor market dynamics; US agricultural exports	TRADE LIBERALIZATION; IMPORT COMPETITION; PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH; EMPLOYMENT; SHOCK	This study empirically investigates the impact of US agricultural exports on farm and nonfarm employment and tests how individuals adjust to agricultural export shocks. Based on the data from 1991 to 2017 and a Bartik-style instrument that exploits cross-regional variation in agricultural export exposure stemming from initial differences in agricultural specialization and temporal variation in predicted US exports from exogenous tariff reductions, we find that a 1% increase in agricultural exports increases farm employment by 0.302% and has no statistically significant impact on nonfarm employment. The individual-level analysis shows that, in response to positive agricultural export demand shocks, natives with a college degree are more likely to become self-employed and start farm activities and while non-natives without a college degree are more likely to become hired farmworkers. A back-of-the-envelope calculation based on the estimates of agricultural trade elasticities of employment shows that on balance, job gains due to US agricultural exports are slightly larger than job loss due to agricultural imports, resulting in a net gain of around 0.24 million farm jobs over 1991-2017.

This lattice interpolates between honeycomb, triangular, and dice lattices, always preserving hexagonal symmetry, and it already has one spin-liquid candidate, TbInO3, albeit with strong spin-orbit coupling not considered here. In addition to the stuffed honeycomb lattice itself, we gain valuable insight into potential spin liquids on the honeycomb and triangular lattices, as well as how they might be connected. For example, the sublattice pairing state proposed on the honeycomb lattice connects to the uniform spinon Fermi surface that may be relevant for the triangular lattice with ring exchange, while there are no spin liquids competitive on both the J(1) - J(2) honeycomb and triangular lattice limits. In particular, we find three stuffed honeycomb descendants of the U(1) Dirac spin liquid widely believed to be found on the J(1) - J(2) triangular lattice. We also discuss how spin liquids near the honeycomb limit can potentially explain the physics of LiZn2Mo3O8.

J	Chapelle, CA				Chapelle, Carol A.			Reflect, Revisit, Reimagine: Language Assessment inARAL	ANNUAL REVIEW OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS			English	Article							PROFICIENCY	This 40(th)anniversary ofARALalso marks the 40-year anniversary of a significant uptick in research on language assessment, and hence there is much to reflect on and revisit within this period-and still scope for imagining the future. Pre-1980, language assessment had a long history, but Spolsky (1995) designated the late 1940s as a time of professionalization, which continued through the following decades. By the 1970s, language testers were gradually organizing into an academic community with an annual international conference, regional conferences, journals, and scholarly books. The new academic community not only developed and used language tests but also investigated the validity of their interpretations and uses. Canale's (1987) paper inARALprovides an enduring frame of reference for reflection on the concerns of the academic community, which he introduced as thewhat,how, andwhyof language assessment.

The Dual Kaczmarz Algorithm	ACTA APPLICANDAE MATHEMATICAE			English	Article						Kaczmarz algorithm; Effective sequence; Frame; Gram matrix; Hilbert space		The Kaczmarz algorithm is an iterative method for solving a system of linear equations. It can be extended so as to reconstruct a vector x in a (separable) Hilbert space from the inner-products {< x,phi n & rang;}. The Kaczmarz algorithm defines a sequence of approximations from the sequence {< x,phi n & rang;}; these approximations only converge to x when {phi n} is effective. We dualize the Kaczmarz algorithm so that x can be obtained from {< x,phi n & rang;} by using a second sequence {psi n}in the reconstruction. This allows for the recovery of x even when the sequence {phi n} is not effective; in particular, our dualization yields a reconstruction when the sequence {phi n} is almost effective. We also obtain some partial results characterizing when the sequence of approximations from {< x,phi n & rang;} using {psi n} converges to x, in which case {(phi n,psi n)} is called an effective pair.

The presented framework could be significantly useful for extending the service life of the pavement, based on their accurate time of application. The presented framework consists of six classified steps to evaluate the existing condition of the pavement, assessing the cost-effectiveness of different maintenance or rehabilitation techniques by conducting Life Cycle Cost Analysis and selecting feasible alternative techniques according to distress types in the flexible pavements. As of the framework, four existing pavements located in Livingston parish in the state of Louisiana have evaluated in detail. Finally, at least two feasible alternatives have suggested for each subsection roads and most cost-effective alternative techniques scored according to assigned weighting factors. Although Different strategies are using by various highway agencies to evaluate the strategy of selection of the appropriate alternative, which is different in the details, the proposed framework could evaluate the uncertainties associated with infrastructure conditions plus determining the optimal inspection, maintenance, and rehabilitation decision policies. This study presents that Micro-surfacing and thin overlay techniques found the most common techniques for the case studies sections, which are according to the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development common treatment selection strategy.

Genetic Control and Geo-Climate Adaptation of Pod Dehiscence Provide Novel Insights into Soybean Domestication	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS			English	Article						domestication; pod dehiscence; seed shattering; candidate gene association analysis; geo-climate adaptation	SIMPLE SEQUENCE REPEAT; GLYCINE-MAX; GLOBAL DISSEMINATION; GENOME; RICE; DIVERSITY; WILD; ASSOCIATION; RESISTANCE; ORIGIN	Loss of pod dehiscence was a key step in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] domestication. Genome-wide association analysis for soybean shattering identified loci harboring Pdh1, NST1A and SHAT1-5. Pairwise epistatic interactions were observed, and the dehiscent Pdh1 overcomes resistance conferred by NST1A or SHAT1-5 locus. Further candidate gene association analysis identified a nonsense mutation in NST1A associated with pod dehiscence. Geographic analysis showed that in Northeast China (NEC), indehiscence at both Pdh1 and NST1A were required in cultivated soybean, while indehiscent Pdh1 alone is capable of preventing shattering in Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH) valleys. Indehiscent Pdh1 allele was only identified in wild soybean (Glycine soja L.) accession from HHH valleys suggesting that it may have originated in this region. No specific indehiscence was required in Southern China. Geo-climatic investigation revealed strong correlation between relative humidity and frequency of indehiscent Pdh1 across China. This study demonstrates that epistatic interaction between Pdh1 and NST1A fulfills a pivotal role in determining the level of resistance against pod dehiscence, and humidity shapes the distribution of indehiscent alleles. Our results give further evidence to the hypothesis that HHH valleys was at least one of the origin centers of cultivated soybean.

In this paper, we present TOSNOS - a prototype end-to-end system that enables efficient and effective shopping experiences for individuals as well as households. Specifically, we provide a solution that seamlessly integrates: (1) automatic generation of items to be included in a shopping list using IoT sensors, (2) the generation of orders to an apriori prescribed online vendor for each item on the shopping list, (3) the detection of user's proximity to an actual store location, and (4) the generation of a notification regarding items that are on sale in the nearby store, which also happen to be in the user's online order and for which the nearby store may be offering discount prices. Our solution not only incorporates different shopping possibilities for the users, but it also enables integration of location-awareness with the user's budget vs. time management. The demo will provide a step-by-step illustration of the main interacting modules of the system, including IoT sensors, database unit, and user interfaces. Furthermore, it will illustrate different heterogeneous functions of the TOSNOS system using example use case scenarios.

Students' journals reveal that both types of assessment have their advantages in the learning process, which results in more autonomous and more efficient learners (Ziegler, 2014). Moreover, data from the two focus groups reveals information about sufficiency, relevance, beneficence, and usefulness about the Spanish speaking activities used in the Spanish for the Professions course. This study presents an assessment use argument following Bachman and Damb6ck (2017) that may be used to design and teach language courses using micro-formative and macro-summative oral assessments. Using an assessment use argument, claims were made about the use of VOICES and OPI. Participants in this study were 13 undergraduate students at a large public university in the Midwest of the United States and one instructor. They were enrolled in an intermediate Spanish conversation course designed for professionals. Language performance data for oral assessments from face-to-face and online formats were evaluated comparing instances of language use. The data showed that the two types of oral assessments engaged learners in different types of learning opportunities.

The architecture uses Zigbee-based (IEEE 802.15.4) wireless sensor networks and publish-subscribe architecture to exchange monitoring and control signals between smart-light actuators (SLAs) and a smart-light central controller (SLCC). Each SLA integrated into a smart light consists of a Zigbee-based endpoint module to send and receive signals to and from the SLCC. The SLCC consists of a Zigbee-based coordinator module, which further exchanges the monitoring and control signals with the active distribution management system over the TCP/IP communication network. The monitoring signals from the SLAs include light status, brightness level, voltage, current, and power data, whereas, the control signals to the SLAs include light intensity, turn ON, turn OFF, standby, and default settings. We have used our existing hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) cyber-physical system (CPS) security SCADA testbed to process signals received from the SLCC and respond suitable control signals based on the smart light schedule requirements, system operation, and active distribution grid dynamic characteristics. We have integrated the proposed cyber-physical smart light control system (CPSLCS) testbed to our existing HIL CPS SCADA testbed. We use the integrated testbed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm by real-time performance and latency between the SLCC and SLAs. The experiments demonstrated significant results by 100% realtime performance and low latency while exchanging data between the SLCC and SLAs.

This study provides a first-look at socialization in the U.S. aerospace and defense (A&D) industry by examining how newly-hired engineers at A&D organizations initiate proactive behaviors and participate in organizational tactics to adjust to their new jobs and organizations. First, the relationships between two sets of socialization processes and socialization outcomes of new engineers were examined. Second, holistic profiles that best characterize newly hired engineers' socialization processes, and whether engineers with different types of profiles present varying socialization outcomes were identified. A total of 86 new engineers who had less than two years of working experience in their A&D organizations were included in this study. Multiple regression and Latent Profile Analyses (LPA) were employed. Study findings show that newly-hired engineers in the A&D industry frequently rely on social interactions to adjust to their job position and organization, and they often participate in organizational tactics more than proactive socialization behaviors. Implications of these findings in the context of A&D workplaces and aerospace engineering education settings are discussed.

Inheritance and fitness costs associated with Cry3Bb1 resistance have been determined for non-diapausing laboratory strains of western corn rootworm with either laboratory-selected resistance or field-derived resistance. However, information on inheritance and fitness costs of Cry3Bb1 resistance in the diapausing field populations is lacking. In this study, we determined the inheritance of Cry3Bb1 resistance for four diapausing field strains of western corn rootworm using plant-based bioassays. We also determined the fitness costs for eight diapausing field populations in a greenhouse experiment. We found that Cry3Bb1 resistance was an autosomal trait and that the inheritance of resistance was mostly non-recessive; however, there was some variation in the dominance of Cry3Bb1 resistance. We did not find evidence of fitness costs affecting survival to adulthood, developmental rate, or adult dry mass. However, we did detect a fitness cost affecting adult size. The results of this study will add to the current understanding of field-evolved resistance to Cry3Bb1 corn by western corn rootworm and help in developing better strategies to manage resistance.

AmpliCI: a high-resolution model-based approach for denoising Illumina amplicon data	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article								Motivation: Next-generation amplicon sequencing is a powerful tool for investigating microbial communities. A main challenge is to distinguish true biological variants from errors caused by amplification and sequencing. In traditional analyses, such errors are eliminated by clustering reads within a sequence similarity threshold, usually 97%, and constructing operational taxonomic units, but the arbitrary threshold leads to low resolution and high false-positive rates. Recently developed 'denoising' methods have proven able to resolve single-nucleotide amplicon variants, but they still miss low-frequency sequences, especially those near more frequent sequences, because they ignore the sequencing quality information. Results: We introduce AmpliCI, a reference-free, model-based method for rapidly resolving the number, abundance and identity of error-free sequences in massive Illumina amplicon datasets. AmpliCI considers the quality information and allows the data, not an arbitrary threshold or an external database, to drive conclusions. AmpliCI estimates a finite mixture model, using a greedy strategy to gradually select error-free sequences and approximately maximize the likelihood. AmpliCI has better performance than three popular denoising methods, with acceptable computation time and memory usage.

Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), particularly O26, O111, and O157 STEC, are often associated with foodborne illness in humans. To create effective preharvest interventions, it is critical to understand which factors STEC strains use to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of cattle, which serves as the reservoir for these pathogens. Several colonization factors are known, but little is understood about initial STEC colonization factors. Our objective was to identify these factors via contrasting gene expression between nonpathogenic E. coli and STEC. Colonic explants were inoculated with nonpathogenic E. coli strain MG1655 or STEC strains (O26, O111, or O157), bacterial colonization levels were determined, and RNA was isolated and sequenced. STEC strains adhered to colonic explants at numerically but not significantly higher levels compared to MG1655. After incubation with colonic explants, flagellin (fliC) was upregulated (log(2) fold-change = 4.0, p < 0.0001) in O157 STEC, and collectively, Lon protease (lon) was upregulated (log(2) fold-change = 3.6, p = 0.0009) in STEC strains compared to MG1655. These results demonstrate that H7 flagellum and Lon protease may play roles in early colonization and could be potential targets to reduce colonization in cattle.

This technical note describes a method for generating probability density functions (PDFs) for one performance characteristic: trunk kinematics. A PDF from the Johnson family of distributions is defined by four parameters (gamma, xi, delta and lambda) and can represent a variety of distributions. In this study, previously published trunk kinematic data were fit to Johnson distributions and regression equations for each of the four parameters were created as a function of starting lift height. Using regression coefficients and Monte Carlo simulation, PDFs for novel lifting conditions were generated. These predicted PDFs were compared with histograms of empirical data collected from a new group of ten lifters performing lifts in these novel conditions. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit test was performed to assess the quality of the fit. Seven of the predicted distributions of these kinematic variables were found to be a good fit with the novel empirical data.

DIFFICILE; DOGS; PERFRINGENS; INFECTION; CATS; VETERINARY; DISEASE	Clostridioides difficile, previouslyClostrdium difficile, is a major cause of antibiotic-associated enteric disease in humans in hospital settings. Increased incidence ofC. difficileinfection (CDI) in community settings raises concerns over an alternative source of CDI for humans. The detection of genetically similar and toxigenicC. difficileisolates in companion animals, including asymptomatic pets, suggests the potential role of household pets as a source of community-associated CDI. The close association between companion animals and humans, in addition to the use of similar antibiotics in both species, could provide a selective advantage for the emergence of newC. difficilestrains and thus increase the incidental transmission of CDI to humans. Therefore, screening household pets forC. difficileis becoming increasingly important from a public health standpoint and may become a part of routine testing in the future, for the benefit of susceptible or infected individuals within a household. In this review, we analyze available information on prevalence, pathophysiology, epidemiology, and molecular genetics ofC. difficileinfection, focusing on companion animals and evaluate the risk of pet-borne transmission of CDI as an emerging public health concern. Molecular epidemiological characterization of companion animalC. difficilestrains could provide further insights into the interspecies transmission of CDI. The mosaic nature ofC. difficilegenomes and their susceptibility to horizontal gene transfer may facilitate the inter-mixing of genetic material, which could increase the possibility of the emergence of new community-associated CDI strains. However, detailed genome-wide characterization and comparative genome analysis are warranted to confirm this hypothesis.

Efficient Far-Red/Near-IR Absorbing BODIPY Photocages by Blocking Unproductive Conical Intersections	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							PHOTOREMOVABLE PROTECTING GROUPS; PHOTOPROTECTING GROUPS; PHOSPHATE-ESTERS; REMOTE-CONTROL; GENERATION; PHOTORELEASE; CHEMISTRY; RELEASE; IONS; FLUOROPHORES	Photocages are light-sensitive chemical protecting groups that give investigators control over activation of biomolecules using targeted light irradiation. A compelling application of far-red/near-IR absorbing photocages is their potential for deep tissue activation of biomolecules and phototherapeutics. Toward this goal, we recently reported BODIPY photocages that absorb near-IR light. However, these photocages have reduced photorelease efficiencies compared to shorter-wavelength absorbing photocages, which has hindered their application. Because photochemistry is a zero-sum competition of rates, improvement of the quantum yield of a photoreaction can be achieved either by making the desired photoreaction more efficient or by hobbling competitive decay channels. This latter strategy of inhibiting unproductive decay channels was pursued to improve the release efficiency of long-wavelength absorbing BODIPY photocages by synthesizing structures that block access to unproductive singlet internal conversion conical intersections, which have recently been located for simple BODIPY structures from excited state dynamic simulations. This strategy led to the synthesis of new conformationally restrained boron-methylated BODIPY photocages that absorb light strongly around 700 nm. In the best case, a photocage was identified with an extinction coefficient of 124000 M-1 cm(-1), a quantum yield of photorelease of 3.8%, and an overall quantum efficiency of 4650 M-1 cm(-1) at 680 nm. This derivative has a quantum efficiency that is 50-fold higher than the best known BODIPY photocages absorbing >600 nm, validating the effectiveness of a strategy for designing efficient photoreactions by thwarting competitive excited state decay channels. Furthermore, 1,7-diaryl substitutions were found to improve the quantum yields of photorelease by excited state participation and blocking ion pair recombination by internal nucleophilic trapping. No cellular toxicity (trypan blue exclusion) was observed at 20 mu M, and photoactivation was demonstrated in HeLa cells using red light.

To determine if a chronic GLY exposure model affected steroidogenesis or folliculogenesis in vivo, postnatal day 42 C57BL6 female mice were orally delivered vehicle control (saline) or GLY (2 mg/Kg) from a pipette tip five days per week for either five or ten weeks. Mice were euthanized at the pro-estrus stage of the estrous cycle. GLY exposure did not impact body weight gain, organ weights, or healthy follicle numbers. In addition, GLY exposure did not affect abundance of ovarian mRNA encoding kit ligand (Kitlg), KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Kit), insulin receptor (Insr), insulin receptor substrate (Irs1 or Irs2) and protein thymoma viral proto-oncogene 1 (AKT) or phosphorylated AKT. Ovarian mRNA or protein abundance of Star, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd3b1), Cyp11a1 or Cyp19a were also not altered by GLY. Circulating 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone concentration were unaffected by GLY exposure. In conclusion, chronic GLY exposure for five or ten weeks did not affect the ovarian endpoints examined herein.

Robust immune responses can be triggered successfully once the vaccine carrying an antigen reaches the mucosal associated lymphoid sites (e.g., Peyer's patches). However, the absence of an efficient delivery method has always been an issue for successful oral vaccine development. In our study, inspired by mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) transport into the gut mucosal lymphoid tissueviaMicrofold cells (M cells), artificial virus-like nanocarriers (AVNs), consisting of gold nanocages functionalized with the sigma 1 protein from mammalian reovirus (MRV), were tested as an effective oral vaccine delivery vehicle targeting M cells. AVNs were shown to have a significantly higher transport compared to other experimental groups across mouse organoid monolayers containing M cells. These findings suggest that AVNs have the potential to be an M cell-specific oral vaccine/drug delivery vehicle.

The SMN loci have been shown to generate a vast repertoire of transcripts, including linear, back- and trans-spliced RNAs as well as antisense long noncoding RNAs.

Nevertheless, very few research-based solutions have been proposed and, of the current recommendations, none are consistently used in practice. Two experiments are presented here. Experiment 1 replicates and extends the Quigley-McBride and Wells (2018) study in which fingerprint lineups (the Filler-Control Procedure) were shown to neutralize the effect of contextual information on novice fingerprint evaluations. Experiment 2 demonstrates that restricting the use of evidence lineups to verification decisions would also be effective for reducing incorrect match decisions without straining resources. In both experiments, the filler-control procedure consistently reduced the effect of suggestive contextual information and protected innocent suspect prints from being mistakenly matched to crime samples. Interdisciplinary approaches are discussed as a way to help close the gap between research and forensic science practice.

AM parts are fabricated layer by layer, which is quite different from traditional formative or subtractive methods. Despite rapid progress in additive manufacturing and associated optical metrology for quality control and in-situ monitoring, limited research has been conducted to investigate the reliability of 3D surface measurement data. The surface topologies scanned by multiple optical systems demonstrated significant differences due to varying sampling mechanisms, resolutions, system noises, etc. The 3D datasets should be trustworthy in order to extract parameters for quality assurance or feedback control from 3D surface measurements. In this paper, we set up new standards to evaluate the reliability of 3D surface measurement data and analyze the variation in the topographical profile. In this study, two non-contact optical methods based on Focus Variation Microscopy (FVM) and Structured Light System (SLS) were adopted to measure the surface topography of the target components. The two optical metrology systems generated two entirely different point cloud datasets. Statistical methods were applied to test the difference between the data obtained from the two systems. By using data analytics approach for comparison, it was found that the surface roughness estimated from the point cloud data sets of FVM and SLS has no significant difference, though the point cloud data sets were completely different. This paper provides standard validation approach to evaluate the plausibility of metrology data from in-situ real-time surface analysis for process planning of AM.

Programmable Liquid Metal Microstructures for Multifunctional Soft Thermal Composites	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article						liquid metal; reconfigurable microstructures; soft materials; stretchable electronics; thermal conductivity	POLYMER COMPOSITES; CONDUCTIVITY; MICROPARTICLES; NANOPARTICLES; MANAGEMENT; PARTICLES; SHAPE	Soft, elastically deformable composites can enable new generations of multifunctional materials for electronics, robotics, and reconfigurable structures. Liquid metal (LM) droplets dispersed in elastomer matrices represent an emerging material architecture that has shown unique combinations of soft mechanical response with exceptional electrical and thermal functionalities. These properties are strongly dependent on the material composition and microstructure. However, approaches to control LM microdroplet morphology to program mechanical and functional properties are lacking. Here, this limitation is overcome by thermo-mechanically shaping LM droplets in soft composites to create programmable microstructures in stress-free materials. This enables LM loadings up to 70% by volume with prescribed particle aspect ratios and orientation, enabling control of microstructure throughout the bulk of the material. Through this microstructural control in soft composites, a material which simultaneously achieves a thermal conductivity as high as 13.0 W m(-1) K-1 (>70 x increase over polymer matrix) with low modulus (<1.0 MPa) and high stretchability (>750% strain) is demonstrated in stress-free conditions. Such properties are required in applications that demand extreme mechanical flexibility with high thermal conductivity, which is demonstrated in soft electronics, wearable robotics, and electronics integrated into 3D printed materials.

Evaluating Soybean Aphid-Resistant Varieties in Different Environments to Estimate Financial Outcomes	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						host plant resistance; integrated pest management; resistance management; economics	HEMIPTERA APHIDIDAE; SEED TRAITS; SINGLE-GENE; RAG1; MANAGEMENT; YIELD	Farmers face many choices when selecting seed for soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) production, including highly desired herbicide tolerance traits. Despite the convenience of herbicide tolerance, resistant weeds and technology fees may reduce utility and profitability of these varieties, especially when commodity prices are low. Sporadic outbreaks of soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura, Hemiptera: Aphididae) that require insecticide use for optimal yield can be a further complication for farmers in Iowa. Soybean aphid-resistant varieties are commercially available, but in limited genetic backgrounds without herbicide tolerance. We hypothesized yield and value of resistance traits will vary based on the environment. We established plots at two locations with different risks of soybean aphid outbreaks and used two planting dates at each location to mimic different yield environments. In 2016 and 2017, we planted four varieties that varied in their susceptibility to soybean aphids and glyphosate, and applied insecticides if aphid populations reached an economic threshold. Regardless of genetic background, aphid-resistant varieties prevented populations from reaching the economic threshold at all environments. We observed no significant difference in yield between resistant and susceptible varieties, revealing this trait is as effective at protecting yield as an insecticide application on susceptible varieties at the high-risk location. We also explored the value of each variety in different environments. Resistant varieties produced greater potential net revenue than susceptible varieties at the high-risk location, while the opposite occurred at the low-risk location. Resistant varieties with herbicide tolerance, if made available, would be the most valuable across all environments.

Comparisons with experiments are performed for flow over a rigidly-mounted (static) cylinder and for an elastically-mounted rigid cylinder oscillating in the transverse direction due to vortex-induced vibration (VIV). For the static cases, measurement data from the literature is used to validate the predictions for normally-incident flow. New experiments are conducted as a part of this study for yawed flow, where the cylinder axis is inclined with respect to the inflow velocity at the desired yaw angle, beta = 30 degrees. Good agreement is observed between the predictions and measurements for mean and rms surface pressure. Three yawed flow cases (beta = 15 degrees, 30 degrees, & 45 degrees) are simulated and the results are found to be independent of beta (independence principle) when the flow speed normal to the cylinder axis is selected as the reference velocity scale. Dynamic (VIV) simulations for an elastically-mounted rigid cylinder are performed by coupling the flow solver with a solid dynamics solver where the cylinder motion is modeled as a mass-spring-damper system. The simulations accurately predict the displacement amplitude and unsteady loading over a wide range of reduced velocity, including the region where "lock-in'' (synchronization) occurs. VIV simulations are performed at two yaw angles, beta = 0 degrees and 45 degrees and the independence principle is found to be valid over the range of reduced velocities tested with a slightly higher discrepancy when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the natural frequency of the system.

Work dedicated to understanding how immune function can be altered with diet has revealed additional functions of required nutrients such as vitamins D and E, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and minerals such as zinc, while feed additives such as phytogenics and probiotics add an additional layer of immunomodulating potential to modern diets. For certain nutrients such as vitamin D or omega-3 PUFA, inclusion above currently recommended levels may optimize immune function and reduce inflammation, while for others such as zinc, additional pharmacological supplementation above requirements may inhibit immune function. Also to consider is the potential to over-immunomodulate, where important functions such as clearance of microbial infections may be reduced when supplementation reduces the inflammatory action of the immune system. Continued work in the area of nutritional immunology will further enhance our understanding of the power of nutrition and diet to improve health in both livestock and companion animals. This review collects examples from several species to highlight the work completed to understand how nutrition can be used to alter immune function, intended or not.

We used a qualitative research method and analysed fourteen in-depth interviews of TGNC individuals. Based upon analysis of the data, three larger themes emerged, each with several subthemes. First, the TGNC participants engaged in extra packing or had additional packing considerations. Second, as participants moved through security, they frequently experienced gender confusion from the TSA agents. Lastly, participants actively thought about passing, or tried to dress in a way where they were perceived as passing as a binary gender. TGNC bodies are rendered as potential threats in binary spaces, specifically those spaces with the purpose of surveillance. In the case of TSA, they disrupt hegemonic expectations surrounding gender and require additional emotional, physical and financial labour. Despite proactivity from other parties to gain them equal access to binary spaces, TGNC individuals still experience, in some cases, additional scrutiny, observation and intensified analysis before being granted access through entryways deemed suitable only to the long-standing hierarchy of the gender binary.

She effectively activates an 'experiential gaze' throughout the film and film-viewing experience that opens up new considerations concerning long-standing views on prostitution, victimization, power, sexuality, and agency in cinema and society. Aided by the iconic French actress Juliette Binoche's sensuous performance, Szumowska materializes in the film's aesthetics the experiential qualities of the senses to present new representations of femininity as 'free' and to question the relationships between subjects and their objective worlds.

We develop a new numerical model of foreign direct investment (FDI) with heterogeneous firms and extension of the Krugman model that allows small countries to impact the number of varieties. We hold both the trade and FDI responses constant across the three market structures. We find that in all three market structures, there are substantial gains from deep integration, but virtually no gains from preferential tariff reduction. Both our Krugman and Melitz style models produce significantly larger welfare gains than the Armington structure, especially if third countries benefit at least partially from the deep integration reforms via either spillovers or wider liberalization.

Food Behaviors, Health, and Bean Nutrition Awareness among Low-Income Men: A Pilot Study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						food behavior; nutrition knowledge; pulses; purchasing preferences; health disparities	DIET QUALITY; CONSUMPTION; KNOWLEDGE; WEIGHT; BENEFITS; COST; BMI	Bean consumption is known to lower blood cholesterol and postprandial blood glucose. With higher chronic disease risk, low-income men could theoretically benefit from increased bean intakes. The study objective was to explore low-income men's food behaviors, bean health benefit awareness, and bean consumption practices and preferences. Seventy-one low-income men aged 18-65 years (mu 41 +/- 12.7; 53% white, 16% black, 31% Hispanic) completed a survey on health risks, food behaviors, bean health knowledge, attitudes toward dry and canned beans, and bean preferences. Eighty-seven percent had one or more health risk factors of physical inactivity, smoking, or obesity. Most men compared food prices, and thought about healthy food choices for their families, but few planned meals or read nutrition facts labels. White men had significantly higher bean health benefit knowledge than black or Hispanic men (p < 0.01). Most men liked the taste of beans, disagreed dry beans took too long to prepare, and 79% ate them at least 2-3 times per month. Forty-nine percent agreed beans caused intestinal gas. Improving men's awareness of the health benefits of beans as well as leveraging existing positive attitudes may be useful approaches to increase bean consumption among low-income and minority male populations.

J	Holme, TA				Holme, Thomas A.			The Winding Path toward Research-Informed Teaching Practices	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Editorial Material						General Public; Curriculum; Interdisciplinary/Multidisciplinary; Professional Development		The idea of using research from cognitive science to make informed decisions about teaching choices often arises in papers and in chemistry education discussions, and in discussions of any area of teaching and learning. At the same time, the continuous growth of what is known about human cognition and how to best advance student learning may present difficult or even conflicting choices. For example, recent replication work has called into question prior research about note-taking using computers that had provided many instructors with guidance about whether or not to allow computers in their classroom. The need to adapt teaching choices to account for new results is always a possibility with research-informed teaching practices because research usually does not provide a clear and indisputably correct direction. Thus, the path taken when using research-based strategies may not always be a straight one for continuous improvement of teaching and learning, but it is arguably a more fruitful pathway than not allowing any changes in how one teaches.

J	Tian, YX; Acevedo, N				Tian, Yixing; Acevedo, Nuria			Role of supramolecular policosanol oleogels in the protection of retinyl palmitate against photodegradation	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							VITAMIN-A; PHOTOSTABILITY; STABILITY; RETINOIDS; ACID; ISOMERIZATION; NANOPARTICLES; FORMULATION; DELIVERY; RELEASE	Exposure of retinyl palmitate (RP) to ultraviolet radiation can lead to its photo-degradation and loss of biological activity. Therefore, there is a demand to explore new approaches to protect RP in an easy, economical and efficient way. The objective of this study was to explore the role of policosanol oleogels (PCOs) in the protection of RP from photodegradation. UV-blocking action was tested by placing a layer of PCO as a barrier between a UVA (365 nm) source and 1% RP in soybean oil. Effects of structural characteristics of PCOs cooled at different rates on RP photostability were also studied. The ability of PCOs to prevent radical-mediated reactions was assessed by measuring oil oxidative stability over storage time at 40 degrees C. The remaining % RP was measured by HPLC during 4 days of UVA irradiation. PCO blocked energy absorption from UVA and further dampened the UVA mediated ionic photodissociation and free radical reactions due to matrix immobilization. After 4 days of UV exposure, photodegradation of RP was reduced by 64% when a PCO layer was used as a barrier. Peroxide values (PV) and p-anisidine values (p-A.V.) of soybean oil (SO) were significantly higher than those of PCOs over storage time. Cooling rate processing played a significant role in RP protection; the faster the cooling rate, the higher the RP photostability. This study demonstrated that the protective mechanism of RP in PCOs is a combined effect of physical UV-barrier action, molecular immobilization and inhibition of the free radical-mediated reaction.

J	Li, ZC; Zheng, JX				Li, Zhaochao; Zheng, Junxing			Structural failure performance of the encased functionally graded porous cylinder consolidated by graphene platelet under uniform radial loading	THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES			English	Article						Structural failure performance; Functionally graded porous (FGP); Graphene platelet (GPL); Confined cylinder; Uniform radial loading; Numerical verification	LAMINATED CYLINDRICAL-SHELLS; EXTERNAL-PRESSURE; FREE-VIBRATION; PIPE LININGS; LINERS; STABILITY; NANOPLATELETS; BEHAVIOR; ARCHES; MODEL	This paper investigates the structural failure mechanism of the functionally graded porous (FGP) cylinder consolidated by graphene platelet (GPL) encased in the rigid medium. Three porous distributions and three GPL dispersion patterns are discussed. The pressurized FGM-GPL cylinder may deform in the shapes characterized by "single-lobe" or "multi-lobe" due to the constraint of the medium. The nonlinear equilibrium equations are developed by the differential of the total potential energy function of the cylinder. The critical buckling pressure of the confined cylinder is obtained theoretically and increases with a higher value of the lobe number. The verification of the present analytical solution is conducted by establishing a two-dimensional (2D) finite element model (FEM). The pressure-displacement equilibrium paths are traced, from which, the maximum pressure (buckling pressure) is determined. Both the analytical and numerical results indicate that the confined FGP-GPL cylinder sustains its highest pressure capacity for the case that the porosity and the GPL are distributed symmetrically to the mid-surface, but non-uniformly through the cross-section. Finally, a full parametric study is mainly focused on the effects of porosity coefficient, and the weight fraction of the GPL on the buckling pressure, the hoop force, the bending moment, the stress and strain distribution on the crown position with the maximum deformation when the critical buckling occurs.

The ability to deliver proteins or protein/RNA complexes into cells allows for producing gene-edited plants that are free of transgene integration in the genome. Here we describe a protocol for the delivery of a protein/gold particle mixture in plant cells through biolistics. The key for the delivery is the drying of the protein/gold suspension directly onto the gene-gun cartridge or macrocarrier. The intracellular protein delivery into plant cells is achieved through the bombardment using the Bio-Rad PDS-1000/He particle delivery device. We termed this methodology "proteolistics."

Hence, through extensive efforts from many research groups, BR signaling has emerged as one of the best-characterized plant signaling pathways. The key molecular players of BR signaling from the cell surface to the nucleus important for the regulation of plant growth and development are well-established. Recent data show that BRs also modulate plant responses to environmental stresses such as drought and pathogen infection. In this mini review, we present the recent progress in BR signaling specifically in the post-translational SUMO modification of BR's master regulators, BES1/BZR1. We also discuss recent findings on the crosstalk between BR, UV light, and jasmonic acid signaling pathways to balance growth during light stress and pathogen infections. Finally, we describe the current update on the molecular link between BR signaling and intracellular auxin transport that essential for plant development.

J	Sen, S				Sen, Srimoyee			Chern insulator transitions with Wilson fermions on a hyperrectangular lattice	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								A U(1) gauge theory coupled to a Wilson fermion on a 2 + 1 dimensional cubic lattice is known to exhibit Chern insulatorlike topological transitions as a function of the ratio M/R where M is the fermion mass and R is the Wilson parameter. I show that, with M and R held fixed, a rectangular lattice with anisotropic lattice spacing can exhibit distinct topological phases as a function of the lattice anisotropy. As a consequence, a 2 + 1 dimensional lattice theory without any domain wall in the fermion mass can still exhibit chiral edge modes on a 1 + 1 dimensional defect across which lattice spacing changes abruptly. Likewise, a domain wall in the fermion mass on a uniform rectangular lattice can exhibit discrete changes in the number and chirality of zero modes as a function of lattice anisotropy. The construction presented in this paper can be generalized to higher dimensional space-time lattices.

J	Wu, ZJ				Wu, Zhijun			Why multilingual, and how to keep it-An evolutionary dynamics perspective	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LANGUAGE; COEXISTENCE; COOPERATION; EXCLUSION	While many languages are in danger of extinction worldwide, multilingualism is being adopted for communication among different language groups, and is playing a unique role in preserving language and cultural diversities. How multilingualism is developed and maintained therefore becomes an important interdisciplinary research subject for understanding complex social changes of modern-day societies. In this paper, a mixed population of multilingual speakers and bilingual speakers in particular is considered, with multilingual defined broadly as zero, limited, or full uses of multiple languages or dialects, and an evolutionary dynamic model for its development and evolution is proposed. The model consists of two different parts, formulated as two different evolutionary games, respectively. The first part accounts for the selection of languages based on the competition for population and social or economic preferences. The second part relates to circumstances when the selection of languages is altered, for better or worse, by forces other than competition such as public policies, education, or family influences. By combining competition with intervention, the paper shows how multilingualism may evolve under these two different sources of influences. It shows in particular that by choosing appropriate interventional strategies, the stable co-existence of languages, especially in multilingual forms, is possible, and extinction can be prevented. This is in contrast with major predictions from previous studies that the co-existence of languages is unstable in general, and one language will eventually dominate while all others will become extinct.

However, the wind-induced response has always been a major concern for tall buildings since it notably influences the serviceability and structural safety of these huge and expensive structures. A large number of studies have been carried out in the past to study the wind-induced response of tall buildings. Despite a considerable amount of research related to this topic, all methodologies used to study the wind-induced vibration of this structure can be briefly classified into three categories of wind tunnel test, numerical simulation, and field measurement. This paper reviews the past studies on wind response of tall buildings while providing sufficient information on the mechanism and identification techniques. The comprehensive literature reviewed here can help to better understand the effects of wind-induced loads on tall buildings and give intuitive insights through comparison of past studies. Moreover, with knowledge of wind-induced response, urban sustainability can be improved by designing tall buildings that are less vulnerable to wind load and lead to more energy-efficient and occupant-friendly cities. Eventually, a roadmap for future research on this topic is provided.

Pharmacokinetics of Oral Prednisone at Various Doses in Dogs: Preliminary Findings Using a Naive Pooled-Data Approach	FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE			English	Article						corticosteroid; prednisone; prednisolone; plasma; canine; pharmacokinetics; na&#239; ve pooled-data; non-compartmental analysis (NCA)	STEADY-STATE; HEMODYNAMIC VARIABLES; CLEARANCE; PLASMA	This pilot study aimed to determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of prednisone and its active metabolite prednisolone following oral prednisone administration in dogs-using dosing regimens that cover anti-inflammatory to immuno-suppressive biological effects. Six healthy Beagle dogs were given 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg prednisone orally once daily for 5 days, each successive course separated by a washout period of 9 days. At steady-state (Day 4), a sparse sampling design allowed for collection of blood from 2/6 individuals for each of the following time points: 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 240, 480, and 720 min. Prednisone and prednisolone were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Oral prednisone was rapidly converted to prednisolone in dogs (<= 30 min), with plasma prednisolone reaching similar to 6-fold greater levels (0-656.1 ng/mL) than prednisone (0-98.8 ng/mL) overall. The ratio of plasma prednisolone/prednisone was constant across the dosing regimens, indicating a non-saturation of the hepatic 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase that converts the prodrug to the active metabolite in dogs. The level of both corticosteroids increased with increasing dosing regimens, albeit in a non-linear manner. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters are described, including peak concentration (C-max), time of peak concentration (T-max), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(last)), and the elimination half-life (t (1/2)) for both corticosteroids, as well as clearance and volume of distribution during the terminal phase (V-z) for the administered drug (prednisone). In sum, the present study utilizes a sparse sampling and naive pooled-data approach to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters for prednisone and prednisolone, providing supporting preliminary knowledge that can be used to optimize corticosteroid efficacy and minimize toxicity in canine patients.

J	Liu, MC; Lyte, M				Liu, Meicen; Lyte, Mark			Pyruvate is required for catecholamine-stimulated growth of different strains of Campylobacter jejuni	PEERJ			English	Article						Campylobacter jejuni; Catecholamines; Stress; Norepinephrine; Dopamine; Iron; Microbial endocrinology; Pyruvate	ENTERIC DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; BACTERIAL-GROWTH; GUT MICROBIOTA; IRON; TRANSFERRIN; ENTEROBACTIN; STRESS; ACQUISITION; LACTOFERRIN	Humans and food-producing animals are constantly exposed to and affected by stress. As a consequence of stress, the release of stress-related catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA), from nerve terminals in the gastrointestinal tract potentiates both the growth and the virulence of pathogenic bacteria. This may lead to the enhancement of gastrointestinal infections in humans or food-producing animals. Compared with foodborne bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp., less is known about the effect of stress catecholamines on Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni. The present study focuses on the effect(s) of stress catecholamines DA and NE in iron-restricted media and how they affect the growth of different C. jejuni strains NCTC 11168, 81-176, and ML2126. Results demonstrated that DA- and NE-enhanced growth of C. jejuni in iron-restricted media may involve different mechanisms that cannot be explained by current understanding which relies on catecholamine-mediated iron delivery. Specifically, we found that DA-enhanced growth requires pyruvate, whereas NE-enhanced growth does not. We further report significant strain-specific dependence of C. jejuni growth on various catecholamines in the presence or absence of pyruvate. These data provide novel insights into the effect(s) of stress catecholamines on the in vitro growth of C. jejuni in iron-restricted environments, such as the intestinal tract. They suggest a mechanism by which stress-related catecholamines affect the growth of C. jejuni in the intestinal tract of food-producing animals, which in turn may influence colonization and transmission to humans.

J	Irish, JEN				Irish, Julie E. N.			Increasing participation: Using the principles of universal design to create accessible conferences	JOURNAL OF CONVENTION & EVENT TOURISM			English	Article						Accessibility; conferences; disability; inclusion; Universal Design	UNITED-STATES; DISABILITY	The Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) mandates the inclusion of individuals with disabilities to a broad range of facilities and public buildings. One overlooked area is access to conferences. Conferences are held in a range of buildings, including purpose-built venues, hotels, and stadia. Often, the focus is on access for people with mobility limitations, but access for people with other disabilities, such as vision or hearing loss, or mental ill-health, can be overlooked. This is a significant oversight since around 19% of the population experience a disability (Brault,2012): it makes sound business sense, as well as a sense of social justice, to ensure more people can access conferences. This article uses a literature review methodology to highlight key considerations to make conferences more accessible to a broad range of people with disabilities. A theoretical framework of Universal Design is proposed to support the ideas. A holistic approach is taken to inclusion, including online booking, transport, and parking, since, without these being accessible, the event becomes inaccessible.

Kentucky bluegrass and bermudagrass rooting response to humic fertilizers during greenhouse establishment	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th Research Conference of the European-Turfgrass-Society (ETS) - Turf Solutions for the Future	JUN 29-JUL 01, 2020	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	European Turfgrass Soc			TALL FESCUE; NUTRIENT CONTENT; SEAWEED EXTRACT; ACID; GROWTH; QUALITY; SOD	Greenhouse research was conducted to examine effects of adding humic products to fertilizers on turfgrass. The objective of this study was to determine if the addition of humic products to fertilizers will increase turfgrass root and shoot morphological parameters. Kentucky bluegrass (KBG; Poa pratensis L.) and bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] were established in sand-filled tubes. Treatments included synthetic fertilizer with black gypsum (22N-0P-3.3K, 30% gypsum and 4.7% humic acid), polymer-coated humic-coated urea (PCHCU; 2% humic acid), urea with humic dispersing granules (HDG; 70% humic acid), starter fertilizer (18N-10.5P-10K) with HDG, starter fertilizer, stabilized nitrogen, urea, and a control group. Fertilizers were applied at 48.8 kg N ha(-1) and HDG was applied at 44.4 kg ha(-1). Starter fertilizer and starter fertilizer with HDG increased KBG total root length (105 and 112%), root biomass (232 and 244%), and shoot biomass (205 and 204%) compared with urea. In KBG, PCHCU and urea with HDG increased total root length (37 and 20%) compared with urea. In bermudagrass, starter fertilizer and starter fertilizer with HDG increased total root length (241 and 248%), root biomass (672 and 707%), and shoot biomass (821 and 808%) relative to urea. Besides treatments with starter fertilizer, no treatments were different from urea for bermudagrass. These results suggest that starter fertilizer application is critical to turfgrass rooting at establishment. Adding humic products to the starter fertilizer did not increase rooting. In the absence of a starter fertilizer, PCHCU and urea with HDG improved KBG total root length compared with urea.

Statistical Assessment of Factor of Safety for Pile-Reinforced Slopes	JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Statistical design of experiments (DoE); Pile-reinforced slopes; Numerical methods; Factor of safety	STABILITY ANALYSIS; LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM; DESIGN	Statistical design of experiments was combined with coupled and uncoupled pile-reinforced slope stability analyses to draw conclusions about the factor of safety (FS) sensitivity to pile-related properties (pile location, spacing, embedment depth, and diameter), and to analyze differences between analytical techniques and space dimensionality. This evaluation performed two- and three-dimensional, limit equilibrium (LE), and finite-element (FE) analyses in a fully randomized block design, a definitive screening design, and a central composite design fashion. Pile location, embedment depth, and spacing had significant effects on FS. The optimum pile location is not fixed, and varies not only with changes in soil strength but also with variations in geometry properties because of the presence of interactions among the factors. The comparative analysis found no statistically significant difference between the studied methods. However, the confidence intervals indicated FS differences as high as 0.27, a variation of crucial importance for practical decision-making when FS is around the stability/failure threshold of 1. Recommendations for analysis and design of pile-reinforced slopes were given.

Jigsaw method improves learning and retention for observation-based undergraduate biology laboratory activities	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						Jigsaw; biology laboratory; quasi-experimental; undergraduate	SMALL FACE; STUDENTS	Complementing biology lecture courses with laboratory sections is nearly universal at undergraduate institutions, yet many topics in biology do not easily lend themselves to experiment-based laboratory activities. Topics such as comparative anatomy, evolution and systematics are often taught as passive, observation-based laboratories. In this experiment, we modified and tested the efficacy of a team-based learning approach called the 'Jigsaw' method in 14 sections of an undergraduate Vertebrate Biology laboratory course at Iowa State University. Specifically, we implemented the modified Jigsaw method in seven lab sections and taught seven lab sections in the traditional lecture and observation style, comparing mean quiz score between the experimental and control sections after accounting for variation due to instructor and year. We revealed significantly higher average quiz scores for students in the experimental sections as compared to the control sections. Herein, we describe the details of our modified Jigsaw implementation that can be applied to other such biology laboratory courses. Thus, we provide further support for the use of team-based learning approaches such as the Jigsaw method and specifically show that undergraduate biology laboratory courses can be improved by implementing such activities in lieu of a clear experimental approach to laboratory courses.

J	Yang, XX; Wei, P				Yang, Xuxi; Wei, Peng			Scalable Multi-Agent Computational Guidance with Separation Assurance for Autonomous Urban Air Mobility	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article							MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; CONFLICT-RESOLUTION; TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT; COLLISION-AVOIDANCE; PLAYERS MODELS; OPTIMIZATION; AIRCRAFT; SAFETY; GAME; STRATEGIES	Electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles are becoming promising for on-demand air transportation in urban air mobility (UAM). However, successfully bringing such vehicles and airspace operations to fruition will require introducing orders of magnitude more aircraft to a given airspace volume. Although there are existing solutions for communication technology, onboard computing capability, and sensor technology, the computation guidance algorithm to enable safe, efficient, and scalable flight operations for dense self-organizing air traffic still remains an open question. In this paper, a message-based decentralized computational guidance algorithm is proposed and analyzed for multiple cooperative aircraft by formulating this problem using multi-agent Markov decision process and solving it by Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. A novel coordination strategy is introduced by using the logit level-kmodel in behavioral game theory. To achieve higher scalability, the airspace sector concept is introduced into the UAM environment by dividing the airspace into sectors, so that each aircraft only needs to coordinate with aircraft in the same sector. At each decision step, all of the aircraft will run the proposed computational guidance algorithm onboard, which can guide all the aircraft to their respective destinations while avoiding potential conflicts among them. For validation and demonstration, a free-flight airspace simulator that incorporates environment uncertainty is built in an OpenAI Gym environment. Numerical experiment results over several case studies, including the roundabout test problem, show that the proposed computational guidance algorithm has promising performance even with the high-density air traffic case.

Recent studies revealed that their functionalities can be further enhanced by spatially modulating the height of their nanoscale pixels. Realizing the concept, however, is very challenging as it requires "grayscale" printing of the nanopixels in which their height is controlled within a few nanometers as a micrometric function of position. This work demonstrates such a high vertical and lateral resolution grayscale printing of polymeric nanopixels. We realize the height modulation by exploiting the discovery that the capillary rise of certain photopolymers can be optically controlled to stop at a predetermined height with sub-10-nm accuracy. Microscale spatial patterning of the control light directly extends the height modulation into a two-dimensionally patterned, grayscale nanopixel printing. Its utility is verified through readily reconfigurable, maskless printing of grayscale nanopixel arrays in dielectric and metallo-dielectric forms. This work also reveals the highly nonlinear and unstable nature of the polymeric nanocapillary effect, expanding its understanding and application scope.

Infield preservation has been a challenge for RNA sample preparation. Very recently, hydrophobic magnetic ionic liquids (MIL) have shown significant promise in the area of RNA extraction. In this study, MILs were synthesized and employed as solvents for the extraction and preservation of RNA in aqueous solution. RNA samples obtained from yeast cells were extracted and preserved by the trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium tris(hexafluoroacetylaceto)-cobaltate(II) ([P-66614(+)][Co(hfacac)(3)(-)]) and trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium tris(phenyltrifluoroacetylaceto)cobaltate(II) ([P-66614(+)] [Co(Phtfacac)(3)(-)]) MIL with a dispersion of the supporting media, polypropylene glycol, at room temperature for up to a 7 and 15 day period, respectively. High-quality RNA treated with ribonuclease A (RNase A) was recovered from the tetra(Ioctylimidazole)cobaltate(II) di(L-glutamate) ([Co(OIM)(4)(2+)] [Glu(-)](2)) and tetra(1-octylimidazole)cobaltate(II) di(L-aspartate) ([Co(OIM)(4)(2+)] [Asp(-)](2)) MILs after a 24 h period at room temperature. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to determine the effect of RNA preservation. Furthermore, the preservation mechanism was investigated by exploring the partitioning of RNase A into the MIL using high-performance liquid chromatography.

The paper aims to: discuss the various simulation methods for power system analysis; highlight the need for modeling unbalanced distribution system for accurate load margin assessment; demonstrate the influence of net-load unbalance (NLU) on voltage stability margin (VSM). We also share a T&D co-simulation interface with commercial power system solvers. The distribution system is evolving rapidly with high proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs); these are not guaranteed to proliferate in a balanced manner and uncertainty resulting due to these DERs is well acknowledged. These uncertainties cannot be captured or visualized without representing the distribution system in detail along with the transmission system. We show the impact of proliferation of DERs in various 3-phase proportions on voltage stability margin through T&D co-simulation. We also study the impact of volt/VAR control on voltage stability margin. This analysis is only possible by representing the distribution system in detail through T&D co-simulation. Higher percentage of net-load unbalance (NLU) in distribution system aggravates the voltage stability margin of the distribution system, which can further negatively influence the overall voltage stability margin of the system.

Selecting appropriate machine learning methods for digital soil mapping	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Algorithm selection; Digital soil mapping; Machine learning; Model evaluation	ORGANIC-CARBON STOCKS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; RANDOM FOREST; SPATIAL PREDICTION; SEMIARID REGION; REGRESSION; SPECTROSCOPY; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION	Digital soil mapping (DSM) increasingly makes use of machine learning algorithms to identify relationships between soil properties and multiple covariates that can be detected across landscapes. Selecting the appropriate algorithm for model building is critical for optimizing results in the context of the available data. Over the past decade, many studies have tested different machine learning (ML) approaches on a variety of soil data sets. Here, we review the application of some of the most popular ML algorithms for digital soil mapping. Specifically, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of multiple linear regression (MLR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), Cubist, random forest (RF), and artificial neural networks (ANN) for DSM. These algorithms were compared on the basis of five factors: (1) quantity of hyperparameters, (2) sample size, (3) covariate selection, (4) learning time, and (5) interpretability of the resulting model. If training time is a limitation, then algorithms that have fewer model parameters and hyperparameters should be considered, e.g., MLR, KNN, SVR, and Cubist. If the data set is large (thousands of samples) and computation time is not an issue, ANN would likely produce the best results. If the data set is small (<100), then Cubist, KNN, RF, and SVR are likely to perform better than ANN and MLR. The uncertainty in predictions produced by Cubist, KNN, RF, and SVR may not decrease with large datasets. When interpretability of the resulting model is important to the user, Cubist, MLR, and RF are more appropriate algorithms as they do not function as "black boxes." There is no one correct approach to produce models for predicting the spatial distribution of soil properties. Nonetheless, some algorithms are more appropriate than others considering the nature of the data and purpose of mapping activity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Struck, C				Struck, Curtis			The role of wind driving in OB star bow nebulae	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						stars: massive; stars: winds outflow; ISM: H II regions	DUST WAVES; RUNAWAY STARS; SHOCKS; PLASMA	Bow-shaped mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission regions have been discovered in satellite observations of numerous late-type O and early-type B stars with moderate velocities relative to the ambient interstellar medium. Previously, hydrodynamical bow shock models have been used to study this emission. It appears that such models are incomplete in that they neglect kinetic effects associated with long mean free paths of stellar wind particles, and the complexity of Weibel instability fronts. Wind ions are scattered in the Weibel instability and mix with the interstellar gas. However, they do not lose their momentum and most ultimately diffuse further into the ambient gas like cosmic rays, and share their energy and momentum. Lacking other coolants, the heated gas transfers energy into interstellar dust grains, which radiate it. This process, in addition to grain photoheating, provides the energy for the emission. A weak R-type ionization front, formed well outside the IR emission region, generally moderates the interstellar gas flow into the emission region. The theory suggests that the IR emission process is limited to cases of moderate stellar peculiar velocities, evidently in accord with the observations.

J	Yan, J; Laflamme, S; Leifsson, L				Yan, Jin; Laflamme, Simon; Leifsson, Leifur			Computational Framework for Dense Sensor Network Evaluation Based on Model-Assisted Probability of Detection	MATERIALS EVALUATION			English	Article						nondestructive evaluation; structural health monitoring; dense sensor network; damage detection; probability of detection; physical surrogate	UNCERTAINTY	Recent sensing advances empower the deployment of dense sensor networks (DSNs) that can be used in automating the condition assessment process of large-scale structural and mechanical systems. To fully enable DSN technologies, it is critical to develop and implement co-design techniques that allow for the evaluation of their performance to attain the condition assessment targets. In this paper, we propose a technique to validate the design of DSNs. The technique consists of constructing a physical surrogate of the DSN-equipped component based on the sensor configuration, updating the physical surrogate using the sliding mode theory based on generated or collected sensor data, and quantifying the performance of the DSN based on model-assisted probability of detection theory. The proposed technique is numerically verified and validated on a cantilever beam subjected to damage at its root and equipped with a network of soft elastomeric capacitors measuring strain. Various uncertainties are considered in the simulated system. The verification consists of confirming the capability of the adaptive process for the surrogate model at reaching an accurate representation of the full system. The validation consists of ranking the performance of various DSN configuration and benchmarking results against those obtained from the full finite element model. Results show that the proposed technique can be used to evaluate the performance of DSN configurations, but that the damage thresholds used in determining damage need to be standardized for successful field applications.

LCI1, a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii plasma membrane protein, functions in active CO2 uptake under low CO2	PLANT JOURNAL			English	Article						CO2; inorganic carbon; LCI1; CO2-concentrating mechanism; Chlamydomonas; photosynthesis; CCM	INORGANIC CARBON TRANSPORT; CONCENTRATING MECHANISMS; LIMITING CO2; ACCLIMATION; EXPRESSION; MUTANT; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; ANHYDRASE; REVEALS; HCO3	In response to high CO2 environmental variability, green algae, such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, have evolved multiple physiological states dictated by external CO2 concentration. Genetic and physiological studies demonstrated that at least three CO2 physiological states, a high CO2 (0.5-5% CO2), a low CO2 (0.03-0.4% CO2) and a very low CO2 (< 0.02% CO2) state, exist in Chlamydomonas. To acclimate in the low and very low CO2 states, Chlamydomonas induces a sophisticated strategy known as a CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) that enables proliferation and survival in these unfavorable CO2 environments. Active uptake of C-i from the environment is a fundamental aspect in the Chlamydomonas CCM, and consists of CO2 and HCO3- uptake systems that play distinct roles in low and very low CO2 acclimation states. LCI1, a putative plasma membrane C-i transporter, has been linked through conditional overexpression to active C-i uptake. However, both the role of LCI1 in various CO2 acclimation states and the species of C-i, HCO3- or CO2, that LCI1 transports remain obscure. Here we report the impact of an LCI1 loss-of-function mutant on growth and photosynthesis in different genetic backgrounds at multiple pH values. These studies show that LCI1 appears to be associated with active CO2 uptake in low CO2, especially above air-level CO2, and that any LCI1 role in very low CO2 is minimal.

J	Smith, JDH				Smith, Jonathan D. H.			Augmented quasigroups and character algebras	ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Quasigroup; Association scheme; Character algebra; Augmented quasigroup; Covering quasigroup; Compact closed category		The conjugacy classes of groups and quasigroups form association schemes, in which the relation products are defined by collapsing group or quasigroup multiplications. In previous work, sharp transitivity was used to identify association schemes, such as certain Johnson schemes, which cannot appear as quasigroup schemes. Thus quasigroup schemes only constitute a fragment of the full set of all association schemes. Nevertheless, the current paper shows that every association scheme is in fact obtained by collapsing a quasigroup multiplication. In a second application of a similar technique, character quasigroups are constructed for each finite group, as analogues of the character groups of abelian groups, to encode the multiplicative structure of group characters. As infrastructure for these and related results, three key unifying concepts in compact closed categories are established: augmented comagmas, augmented magmas, and augmented quasigroups, the latter serving to capture such diverse structures as groups and Heyting algebras.

The Emerging Role of Prepublication in Chemistry Education	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Editorial Material						General Public; Interdisciplinary/Multidisciplinary; Professional Development		The role of journal publications for academics has an interesting mix of long-standing values and new opportunities and challenges. As such, occasional adjustments to the expectations the Journal has for authors are important to consider. With the emergent success of ChemRxiv as a preprint server for the chemistry community, its role in chemistry education publications is particularly important to update. New author guidelines have been posted to the Journal website, and they include the addition of prepublication posting of manuscripts on the ChemRxiv server. The benefits of ChemRxiv and the reasoning behind the changes are discussed in this editorial.

A method of back-calculating the log odds ratio and standard error of the log odds ratio from the reported group-level risk of disease	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EPIDEMIOLOGY; EXPLANATION	In clinical trials and observational studies, the effect of an intervention or exposure can be reported as an absolute or relative comparative measure such as risk difference, odds ratio or risk ratio, or at the group level with the estimated risk of disease in each group. For meta-analysis of results with covariate adjustment, the log of the odds ratio (log odds ratio), with its standard error, is a commonly used measure of effect. However, extracting the adjusted log odds ratio from the reported estimates of disease risk in each group is not straightforward. Here, we propose a method to transform the adjusted probability of the event in each group to the log of the odds ratio and obtain the appropriate (approximate) standard error, which can then be used in a meta-analysis. We also use example data to compare our method with two other methods and show that our method is superior in calculating the standard error of the log odds ratio.

Bean Preferences Vary by Acculturation Level among Latinas and by Ethnicity with Non-Hispanic White Women	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						pulses; food security; canned foods; Mexican Americans; dietary acculturation; consumer preferences; immigrants; health disparities; nutrition knowledge	DIETARY ACCULTURATION; MEXICAN-AMERICANS; FOOD; CONSUMPTION; INCOME; ADJUSTMENT; BEHAVIORS; EDUCATION; IDENTITY; FREQUENT	With high levels of protein, fiber, folate, iron and other micronutrients, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends eating beans for optimal nutrition. Low-income women are at greater risk of nutrition-related health disparities. Use of beans may change among Hispanic women (Latinas) during acculturation, but few studies exist that describe specific preferences of this important traditional food. Preserving or promoting beans in the diets of all low-income women could improve dietary quality. The study objectives were to describe consumption frequency, purchasing patterns, and attitudes toward dry and canned beans, by acculturation level among Latinas and by ethnicity with non-Hispanic White women. Survey data were collected from 356 women (mu 32 y +/- 9 y; 81% Latina), who were enrolled in, or eligible for, a federal nutrition assistance, or unemployment, program in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Participants had positive attitudes toward beans overall. Less acculturated and bicultural Latinas bought dry beans more often than their peers. Price was considered important in canned bean selection for Non-Hispanic White women, and less acculturated Latinas had poorer attitudes toward canned. Awareness of these attitudes and preferred traits of low-income women suggests ways to message populations to maintain or increase bean consumption. Negative views of canned beans by Latinas should be investigated further. Inclusion of canned beans in nutrition assistance programs may benefit those unfamiliar with preparing dry beans.

Usability Testing and the Development of an Augmented Reality Application for Laboratory Learning	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						First-Year Undergraduate/General; Laboratory Instruction; Internet/Web-Based Learning; Laboratory Equipment/Apparatus	CHEMISTRY; ATTITUDE	In general chemistry laboratories, students learn practical laboratory skills through hands-on activities and are exposed to new scientific instruments. However, these instruments are often viewed as black boxes for various reasons, where students do not know how to use them or what the instruments are capable of. This tendency is likely to induce some measure of fear in the students' attitude toward learning about instruments, even though instrumentation is a significant part of laboratory education. Augmented reality in educational laboratory (ARiEL) is an application utilizing AR technology designed to connect students to information on scientific instruments. ARiEL can be downloaded and used on phones or tablets while students are working on experiments, providing them with direct and immediate forms of information about laboratory instruments. Currently, the pH meter and conductivity meter are two instruments ARiEL can recognize as they are small, benchtop devices often used in general chemistry laboratory courses. An initial usability study with a focus group of first-term general chemistry students indicated that the application is not only easy to use but also preferred over a common search engine when looking for information on specific instruments. The application was used in a second-term general chemistry laboratory course and tested for usability evaluation and to measure students' attitude toward chemistry instrumentation. The results suggest that the availability of ARiEL helps to reduce anxiety associated with using instruments and to improve intellectual accessibility.

Using ArcGIS hydrologic modeling and LiDAR digital elevation data to evaluate surface runoff interception performance of riparian vegetative filter strip buffers in central Iowa	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						best management practices (BMPs); coefficient of flow interception; digital elevation model; light detection and ranging (LiDAR); nonpoint source pollution; vegetative filter strip	SEDIMENT; REMOVAL	The Midwest is well known for agriculture, and Iowa is a leader in corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) production. Fertilizers and chemical pesticides used to increase crop production can adversely affect the soil and water health. Midwest farmers also produce livestock and graze cattle on pastureland that can lead to excessive surface runoff and soil erosion. Establishing vegetative filter strips (VFSs) along the edge of farmland is one of the best management practices (BMPs) to reduce nutrient and sediment loss. However, studies have revealed that the classic VFS design along the length of an agricultural field does not adequately address nonuniform flow through the buffer. New designs are being researched to increase the efficiency of the VFS. In order to accurately implement new design strategies, the runoff flowpaths into the VFS need to be accurately modeled. This research assesses the performance of existing established VFS buffers of selected sites by modeling and analyzing the flow accumulation from the field into the VFS using geographic information system (GIS) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) derived digital elevation model (DEM) 5 x 5 m data. This study also employed the new coefficient of flow interception (CFI) approach that improves the process of identifying areas where flow is concentrated and designing more efficient filter strips to account for concentrated runoff. In this study, the performance of VFS in three sites was evaluated by developing and using the CFI. Among the three sites, site 1 had very poor efficiency and no flow passes through the VFS, site 2 had low efficiency, and site 3 had excellent efficiency.	[Shrivastav, M.; Mickelson, S.

Adding to this challenge, a node typically has little control over its intermittency. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a new class of protocols, which we call lifecycle management protocols (LMPs), to better control and manage the intermittency of batteryless nodes. These protocols may be designed and optimized for a particular task; here, we propose and evaluate a set of LMPs designed to enable direct communication between intermittent batteryless sensor nodes with active radios.

This potentiating effect of interpolated testing has been extensively investigated in multi-list learning paradigms. However, extant studies in this literature have manipulated interpolated testing in a binary manner, such that participants either took a test after every list or they are not tested until the final list. In reality, when students prepare for an exam, they are unlikely to test themselves consistently at regular intervals. Therefore, a critical question is whether interpolated testing would potentiate new learning when interpolated testing stops but encoding continues. In four experiments, we compared memory performance across participants who received an interpolated test after every list, received no interpolated tests, or received interpolated tests during only the early lists. Results showed that retrieval enhanced new learning even when testing was terminated early, although the benefits were weakened substantially. Further, participants' test expectancy ratings and semantic clustering scores provide support for the idea that retrieval promotes new learning by independently enhancing attentional and organizational processes.

J	Ma, LQ; Zhang, ZC; Gao, LY; Hu, H				Ma, Liqun; Zhang, Zichen; Gao, Linyue; Hu, Hui			An exploratory study on using Slippery-Liquid-Infused-Porous-Surface (SLIPS) for wind turbine icing mitigation	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Wind turbine icing; SLIPS; Impact ice accretion; Icephobic coatings; Anti-/de-icing	DEICING TECHNIQUES; SOLID-SURFACES; ICE ACCRETION; ADHESION; IMPACT; WETTABILITY; PERFORMANCE	An experimental study was conducted to explore the potentials of using a Slippery-Liquid-Infused -Porous-Surface (SLIPS) for wind turbine icing mitigation. The SLIPS was prepared by infusing a lubricant oil into a nanofibrous membrane, which can stick firmly to the surface of a turbine blade model. While the SLIPS was found to effectively suppress impact ice accretion on the blade surface where strong aerodynamic forces are exerted, ice was still found to accrete in the vicinity of the blade stagnation line where aerodynamic forces are at their minimum. A novel hybrid anti-/de-icing strategy to integrate the SLIPS with a minimized leading-edge heating was demonstrated to effectively remove the ice accretion over entire blade surface. An comprehensive experimental study was also performed to evaluate the durability of the SLIPS to resist wearing away of the substrate materials and depletion of the infused lubricant oil due to "rain erosion" effects, in considering its practical usage for wind turbine icing mitigation. It was found that the "rain erosion" effects would induce significant surface wettability degradation, substantial ice adhesion increment and even structural failures to the SLIPS as the duration of the rain erosion testing increases.

Pharmacokinetics and Tissue Levels of Pantoprazole in Neonatal Calves After Intravenous Administration	FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE			English	Article						calf; bovine; pantoprazole; pharmacokinetics; tissue residue; pantoprazole sulfone	PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS; ABOMASAL LUMINAL PH; ANAPHYLACTIC REACTIONS; MANAGEMENT; VALUES; EDEMA	Background: Neonatal calves are at risk of developing abomasal ulceration, but there is a lack of pharmacokinetic data for potential anti-ulcerative therapies, such as pantoprazole, in ruminant species. Objective: The study objectives were to estimate plasma pharmacokinetic parameters for pantoprazole in neonatal dairy calves after intravenous (IV) administration. A secondary objective was to quantify the concentrations of pantoprazole in edible tissues after IV dosing. Methods: Pantoprazole was administered to 9 neonatal Holstein calves at a dose of 1 mg/kg IV. Plasma samples were collected over 24 h and analyzed via HPLC-MS for determining pantoprazole concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived via non-compartmental analysis. Tissue samples were collected at 1, 3, and 5 days after administration and analyzed via HPLC-MS. Results: Following IV administration, plasma clearance, elimination half-life, and volume of distribution of pantoprazole were estimated at 4.46 mL/kg/min, 2.81 h, and 0.301 L/kg, respectively. The global extraction ratio was estimated at 0.053 +/- 0.015. No pantoprazole was detected in the edible tissues 1, 3, or 5 days after administration. A metabolite, pantoprazole sulfone was detected in all the edible tissues 1 and 3 days after administration. Conclusion: The reported plasma clearance for pantoprazole is less than that reported for alpacas but higher than reported in foals. The elimination half-life in calves appears to be longer than observed in foals and alpacas. While pantoprazole sulfone was detected in the tissues after IV administration, further research is needed as to the metabolism and potential tissue accumulation of other pantoprazole metabolites in calves. Future pharmacodynamic studies are necessary to determine the efficacy of pantoprazole on abomasal acid suppression in calves.

A super source follower is inserted into a cascoded flipped voltage follower to drive the power transistor, which forms a fast-local loop for quick turn-on. A robust overshoot detection circuit consuming only leakage current is proposed for fast turn-off. The combination of these two techniques significantly reduce the overshoot/undershoot voltages and achieve fast settling time during load steps. A simple yet effective additional turn-around stage is added in the error amplifier to improve the positive phase slew rate for potential dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) function in battery-operated systems. The LDO is implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process and it can deliver a 20 mA load current with 0.9 V regulated output and 150 mV dropout voltage. It occupies an active area of 0.01 mm2 and can work stably in a load range from 0 to 20 mA with 65 mu A quiescent current. The measured results show a settling time about 100 ns for load steps from 100 mu A to 20 mA as well as V-REF and V-IN steps.

A survey of RNA secondary structural propensity encoded within human herpesvirus genomes: global comparisons and local motifs	PEERJ			English	Article						RNA; Herpes viruses; Motif scan; RNA structure; EBV; KSHV; PAN; EBNA1	EPSTEIN-BARR-VIRUS; NONCODING RNA; NUCLEAR-RNA; ALIGNMENT; MAFFT; RFAM; FAMILIES; PROTEIN; PARALLELIZATION; IDENTIFICATION	There are nine herpesviruses known to infect humans, of which Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most widely distributed (>90% of adults infected). This ubiquitous virus is implicated in a variety of cancers and autoimmune diseases. Previous analyses of the EBV genome revealed numerous regions with evidence of generating unusually stable and conserved RNA secondary structures and led to the discovery of a novel class of EBV non-coding (nc)RNAs: the stable intronic sequence (sis)RNAs. To gain a better understanding of the roles of RNA structure in EBV biology and pathogenicity, we revisit EBV using recently developed tools for genome-wide motif discovery and RNA structural characterization. This corroborated previous results and revealed novel motifs with potential functionality; one of which has been experimentally validated. Additionally, since many herpesviruses increasingly rival the seroprevalence of EBV (VZV, HHV-6 and HHV-7 being the most notable), analyses were expanded to include all sequenced human Herpesvirus RefSeq genomes, allowing for genomic comparisons. In total 10 genomes were analyzed, for EBV (types 1 and 2), HCMV, HHV-6A, HHV-6B, HHV-7, HSV-1, HSV-2, KSHV, and VZV. All resulting data were archived in the RNAStructuromeDB (https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/herpesvirus) to make them available to a wide array of researchers.

J	Baum, ME; Licht, MA; Huber, I; Archontoulis, SV				Baum, Mitch E.; Licht, Mark A.; Huber, Isaiah; Archontoulis, Sotirios, V			Impacts of climate change on the optimum planting date of different maize cultivars in the central US Corn Belt	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						Planting date; Maize cultivars; Climate change; Frost free period; Modeling; APSIM	CENTRAL UNITED-STATES; HEAT-STRESS; SOWING DATE; CROP; YIELDS; MODEL; NITROGEN; SYSTEMS; WATER; GROWTH	Planting date and cultivar selection are major factors in determining the yield potential of any crop and in any region. However, there is a knowledge gap in how climate scenarios affect these choices. To explore this gap, we performed a regional scale analysis (11 planting dates x 8 cultivars x 281 fields x 36 weather years x 6 climate scenarios) using the APSIM model and pSIMS software for Iowa, the leading US maize (Zea mays L.) producing state. Our objectives were to determine how the optimum planting date (optPD)changes with weather scenarios and cultivars and the potential economic implications of planting outside the optimum windows. Results indicated that the mean optPD corresponds to the US Department of Agriculture, National Agriculture Statistics Service (USDA-NASS) 18.4% planting progress (April 28th) in Iowa. The opt optPD was found to be advancing by -0.13 d yr(-1) from 1980 to 2015. A 1 degrees C increase in mean temperature increased the length of the growing season by 10 days while the opt PD changed by -2 to + 6 days, depending on cultivar. Under a more realistic scenario of increasing the minimum temperature by 0.5 degrees C, decreasing the maximum temperature by 0.5 degrees C, increasing spring rainfall by 10% and decreasing summer rainfall by 10%, the optPD only changed by -2 days compared to current trends, however, yield increased by 6.6%. Analysis of historical USDA-NASS planting durations indicated that on average, the planting duration (1-99% statewide reported planting progress) is 44 days, while it can be as low as 21 days in years with favorable weather. A simple economic analysis illustrated a potential revenue loss up to $340 million per year by planting maize outside the optimum window. We conclude that future investments in planting technologies to accelerate planting, especially in challenging weather years, as well as improved optPD x cultivar recommendations to farmers, will provide economic benefits and buffer climate variability.

Effects of maintaining eucalcemia following immunoactivation in lactating Holstein dairy cows	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						calcium; endotoxin; inflammation; infection	CALCIUM-SENSING RECEPTOR; INNATE IMMUNE-RESPONSES; SUBCLINICAL HYPOCALCEMIA; MILK-YIELD; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE INFUSION; PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; IONIZED HYPOCALCEMIA; NEUTROPHIL FUNCTION; EXTRACELLULAR CA2+	Periparturient hypocalcemia is a common metabolic disorder and it is ostensibly associated with negative health and production outcomes. Acute infection also markedly decreases circulating Ca, but the reasons for and consequences of it on physiological and immuno-logical parameters are unknown. Objectives were to evaluate the effects of maintaining eucalcemia on pro-duction, metabolic, and immune variables following an intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Twelve multiparous lactating Holstein cows (717 +/- 20 kg of body weight; 176 +/- 34 d in milk; parity 3 +/- 0.2) were enrolled in a study containing 2 experimental periods (P); during P1 (3 d), cows consumed feed ad libitum and baseline values were obtained. At the initiation of P2 (4 d), cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treat-ments: (1) LPS administered (LPS-Con; 0.5 mu g/kg of body weight LPS; n = 6) or (2) LPS administered + eucalcemic clamp (LPS-Ca; 0.5 mu g/kg of body weight LPS; Ca infusion; n = 6). Cows were fasted for the first 12 h during P2. After LPS administration, ionized Ca was determined every 15 min for 6 h and every 30 min for an additional 6 h and intravenous Ca infusion was adjusted in LPS-Ca cows to maintain eucalcemia. Blood ionized Ca was decreased 23% for the first 12 h postbolus in LPS-Con cows, and by design, Ca infusion prevented hypocalcemia. To maintain eucalcemia for the 12 h, 13.7 g of Ca was infused. The total Ca deficit (including Ca not secreted into milk) accumulated over the 12 h was 10.4 and 20.2 g for the LPS-Con and LPS-Ca treatments, respectively. Mild hyperthermia (0.8 degrees C) occurred for similar to 6 h post-LPS administration relative to P1. From 6 to 7 h postbolus rectal temperature from LPS-Ca cows was increased (0.6 degrees C) relative to LPS-Con cows. On d 1 of P2, milk yield decreased (61%) in both treatments relative to P1. Relative to LPS-Con cows, milk yield decreased (15%) in LPS-Ca cows during P2. Overall, circulating LPS-binding protein continuously increased postbolus, and at 24 h LPS-binding protein levels in LPS-Ca cows were increased (80%) relative to LPS-Con cows. During P2, serum amyloid A increased (4-fold) in both treatments relative to P1. Administer-ing LPS initially decreased circulating neutrophils, then cell counts progressively increased with time. Calcium infusion decreased neutrophil counts (40%) from 9 to 12 h postbolus relative to LPS-Con cows. Neutrophil function, as assessed by oxidative burst and myeloper-oxidase production, did not differ due to treatment. In summary, maintaining eucalcemia (via intravenous Ca infusion) during an immune challenge appeared to intensify inflammation and adversely affect lactation performance.	[Horst, E. A.; Mayorga, E.

J	Miller, J; Hoover, M; Winer, E				Miller, Jack; Hoover, Melynda; Winer, Eliot			Mitigation of the Microsoft HoloLens' hardware limitations for a controlled product assembly process	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Augmented reality; Work instructions; Assembly; HoloLens	AUGMENTED REALITY APPLICATIONS	Studies have shown that using augmented reality (AR) reduces time and errors by as much as 50% for manufacturing and assembly operations. The use of head-mounted displays (HMDs) is very interesting for these situations as they free up a user's hands. However, with the technology behind these HMDs still under development, limitations in input, field of view, tracking, and occlusion exist. For AR assembly instructions to be effective, these limitations must be mitigated so that a user receives accurate instructions. To investigate this, an application was developed that guides a user through the assembly of a mock aircraft wing using AR on a Microsoft HoloLens 1. The application displays 3D work instructions, user interfaces, and spatially registered content. To ensure accurate instructions were displayed, techniques were developed to mitigate the HoloLens' tracking and display limitations. Image tracking was implemented to augment the HoloLens' limited position determination, stabilize spatially registered virtual content, and account for spatial drift. Also, 3D augmented content was optimized for clarity through the display using specialized computer graphics methods. Lastly, the system provides raw data regarding head position, orientation, and assembly step times. A visualization application was developed that combines this information with wearable sensor data, to examine trends exhibited by a user during the assembly tasks and validate the delivered instructions. The outcomes of this research provided solutions to address limitations of the HoloLens for broad use.

Wind-induced response characteristics of a yawed and inclined cable in ABL wind: Experimental- and numerical-model based study	ENGINEERING STRUCTURES			English	Article						Aeroelastic cable model; Dry galloping; Wind-induced vibration; Inclined cable; Aerodynamic cable damping; FEA of cable	INDUCED VIBRATIONS; STAY CABLES	Inclined cables used in bridges or other infrastructures are vulnerable to unsteady wind-induced loads producing moderate- to large-amplitude vibration that may result in damage or failure of the cables, resulting in catastrophic failure of the structure they secure. In the present study, wind-induced response of an inclined smooth cable was studied through wind tunnel measurements using a flexible cable model for a better understanding of the vibration characteristics of structural cables in atmospheric boundary layer wind. For this purpose, in-plane and out-of-plane responses of a sagged and a non-sagged flexible cable were recorded by four accelerometers. Four cases with different yaw and inclination angles of a cable with approximate sag ratios of 1/10 were studied to investigate the wind directionality effect on its excitation mode(s) and response amplitude. Cable tension was also measured during all experiments to assess the correlation of wind speed, excitation vibration mode, and natural frequency of the cable with change in cable tension. Additionally, two inclined cables with no sag were tested to determine the influence of sag of a cable on its vibration characteristics. In the second part of this study, a series of finite element analyses were conducted to predict the wind-induced aerodynamic damping of an inclined bridge cable. Experimental results showed that excitation mode(s) of a cable depend on wind speed, inclination angle, and sag ratio and cable tension. First, second, and third vibration modes were observed at a low wind speed for different test cases, whereas higher vibration modes were observed to contribute to the cable response at high wind speeds. Moreover, it was seen that the cable tension significantly increased with wind speed resulting in increased value of the excited natural frequency. Numerical results obtained through finite element analysis of an inclined full-scale cable showed that the criteria that are based on section models can underestimate the critical reduced velocity for dry cable galloping.

The impact of porcine spray-dried plasma protein and dried egg protein harvested from hyper-immunized hens, provided in the presence or absence of subtherapeutic levels of antibiotics in the feed, on growth and indicators of intestinal function and physiology of nursery pigs	TRANSLATIONAL ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						functional protein; IgY; in-feed antibiotics; intestinal inflammation and morphology; spray-dried plasma protein; weaned pig	ESCHERICHIA-COLI K88; EARLY-WEANED PIGS; TIGHT JUNCTION PROTEINS; ANIMAL PLASMA; WEANLING PIGS; BARRIER FUNCTION; FED DIETS; PERFORMANCE; EXPRESSION; ANTIBODIES	The objective of this experiment was to compare the effects of spray-dried plasma protein (SDPP) and dried egg protein (DEP), without (AB-) or with (AB+) in-feed antibiotics, on growth performance and markers of intestinal health in nursery pigs raised in commercial conditions. This 42-d experiment utilized 1,230 pigs (4.93 +/- 0.04 kg body weight; approximately 15-18 d of age). Pigs were randomly assigned to one of six dietary treatments that were arranged as a 2 x 3 factorial of in-feed antibiotics (AB- vs. AB+) and a specialty protein additive (none [CON], porcine SDPP, or DEP). Diets were fed in four phases with phases 3 and 4 as a common diet across all treatments. Specialty protein additives were fed in phases 1 (0-13 d; 3% SDPP, and 0.20% DEP) and 2 (13-26 d; 2% SDPP, and 0.10% DEP). Antibiotics were fed in phases 1-3 (662 mg chlortetracycline [CTC]/kg, 28 mg carbadox/kg, and 441 mg CTC/kg, respectively). Ileal tissue and blood samples were collected from 48 pigs (8 per treatment) on d 20. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED of SAS (9.4) with pen as the experimental unit; protein additives, antibiotics, and their interaction were fixed effects and block was a random effect. The pigs experienced naturally occurring health challenges in weeks 2 and 4. In the AB- diets, SDPP and DEP increased average daily gain (ADG; P = 0.036) and average daily feed intake (ADFI; P = 0.040) compared to CON; in the AB+ diets, neither SDPP nor DEP increased ADG or ADFI compared to CON but SDPP did increase these parameters over DEP. The SDPP and DEP diets decreased the number of individual medical treatments compared to CON (P = 0.001). The AB+ increased ileal mucosal interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (P = 0.017). Feeding DEP reduced the concentration of mucosal IL-1 beta compared to CON, but not SDPP (P = 0.022). There was a trend for SDPP and DEP to increase villus height:crypt depth compared to CON (P = 0.066). Neither antibiotics or protein additive affected serum malondialdehyde concentration or ileal mRNA abundance of claudin-3 or 4, occludin, or zonula occludens-1 (P > 0.10). In conclusion, SDPP and DEP improved growth performance of weaned pigs in the absence of antibiotics but neither improved growth compared to CON when feeding standard antibiotic levels. The specialty proteins had a positive effect on health; specialty proteins and antibiotics were able to modulate some markers of intestinal inflammation and morphology.

Information flows and topic modeling in corporate governance	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Corporate governance; Bibliometrics; Citation analysis; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Agency theory; Director; Interdisciplinary	INTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE; BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; COCITATION ANALYSIS; CITATION; SCIENCE; FIELD; UNIVERSITY; LOGISTICS; EVOLUTION	Purpose Multiple disciplines such as finance, management and economics have contributed to governance research over time. However, the full intellectual structure of the governance "field" including the exchange of knowledge across disciplines and the large variety of governance topics remains to be uncovered. To appreciate the breadth of corporate governance research, it is necessary to understand the disciplinary sources from which the research stems. This manuscript focuses on the interdisciplinary underpinnings of corporate governance research. Design/methodology/approach This paper employs bibliometric analysis to trace the evolution of corporate governance using articles included in the ISI Web of Science database between 1990 and 2015. Journals included in these categories encompass a full range of business disciplines and provide evidence of the multi-disciplinary nature of corporate governance. It also uncovers the topics treated by disciplines under the governance umbrella using a machine learning method called latent Dirichtlet allocation (LDA). Findings Corporate governance research deals with a number of strategy-related topics. Unlike strategy topics that reside in a single discipline, corporate governance crosses disciplinary boundaries and includes contributions from accounting, finance, economics, law and management. Our analysis shows that over 80% of corporate governance articles come from outside the field of management. Our LDA solution indicates that the major topics in governance research include corporate governance theory, control of family firms, executive compensation and audit committees. Originality/value The results illustrate that corporate governance is far more interdisciplinary than previously thought. This is an important insight for corporate governance academics and may lead to collaborative research. More importantly, this research illustrates the usefulness of LDA for investigating interdisciplinary fields. This method is easily transferable to other interdisciplinary fields and it provides a powerful alternative to existing bibliometric methods. We suggest a number of topic areas within library and information science where this method may be applied, including collection development, support for interdisciplinary faculty and basic research into emerging interdisciplinary areas.

Effects of processing method and nonmeat binding ingredients on batter stability, yield and texture of frankfurters	JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION			English	Article							MICROBIAL TRANSGLUTAMINASE; MYOFIBRILLAR PROTEIN; PORK; FAT; CARRAGEENAN; SAUSAGES; COLLAGEN; SALT	The effects of processing method and added nonmeat ingredients on yield, batter stability, and texture of frankfurters were investigated. Five ingredient treatments (control, sodium alginate (SA), iota carrageenan, transglutaminase (TG), and pork collagen) for frankfurters were produced using three processing methods (coarse grinding, bowl chopper [BC], and emulsion mill [EM]) for each ingredient. Control treatments produced by different methods showed greater (p < .05) processing yield (PY) with the EM, followed by the BC, and coarse grinding, respectively. The addition of TG had a positive impact on textural characteristics of chewiness and cohesiveness, but did not affect PY. As might be expected, differences between frankfurters produced with the different processing methods were observed in this study, and a means to compensate for some of the differences by addition of nonmeat ingredients to the formulations was demonstrated. Practical applications This study evaluated the performance of nonmeat binding agents for improving yield and textural quality of sausage products manufactured with three types of comminution equipment. Iota carrageenan and sodium alginate (SA) have potential to improve water retention and yields, depending on the comminution system chosen. Transglutaminase (TG) can be used to modify textural characteristics, particularly in coarsely comminuted products. Combining iota carrageenan or SA with TG showed the greatest potential to compensate for product differences that might be produced by different comminution systems.

J	Khaki, S; Khalilzadeh, Z; Wang, LZ				Khaki, Saeed; Khalilzadeh, Zahra; Wang, Lizhi			Predicting yield performance of parents in plant breeding: A neural collaborative filtering approach	PLOS ONE			English	Article							REGRESSION; NETWORKS	Experimental corn hybrids are created in plant breeding programs by crossing two parents, so-called inbred and tester, together. Identification of best parent combinations for crossing is challenging since the total number of possible cross combinations of parents is large and it is impractical to test all possible cross combinations due to limited resources of time and budget. In the 2020 Syngenta Crop Challenge, Syngenta released several large datasets that recorded the historical yield performances of around 4% of total cross combinations of 593 inbreds with 496 testers which were planted in 280 locations between 2016 and 2018 and asked participants to predict the yield performance of cross combinations of inbreds and testers that have not been planted based on the historical yield data collected from crossing other inbreds and testers. In this paper, we present a collaborative filtering method which is an ensemble of matrix factorization method and a neural network to solve this problem. Our computational results suggested that the proposed model significantly outperformed other models such as deep factorization machines (DeepFM), generalized matrix factorization (GMF), LASSO, random forest (RF), and neural networks. Presented method and results were produced within the 2020 Syngenta Crop Challenge.

We analyzed putative mechanisms behind and functional significance of this variation by performing comparative analysis of the experimentally-verified mitochondrial proteomes of four bilaterian animals (human, mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster) and two non-animal outgroups (Acanthamoeba castellanii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We found that of several factors affecting mitochondrial proteome size, evolution of novel mitochondrial proteins in mammals and loss of ancestral proteins in protostomes were the main contributors. Interestingly, the gain and loss of the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal was not a major factor in the proteome size evolution.

Behaviour and survival of wild versus stocked fingerling walleye	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						habitat; hatchery; mortality; movement; program MARK; stocking	COARSE WOODY HABITAT; LARGEMOUTH BASS; STIZOSTEDION-VITREUM; STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY; ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS; SURGICAL-PROCEDURES; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; PREY INTERACTIONS; STRESS RESPONSES; ONTOGENIC NICHE	Walleye Sander vitreus Mitchill have been progressively raised in hatcheries to larger sizes under the paradigm that larger stocked fish have higher survival. However, extended time in hatcheries may result in domestication, with stocked individuals lacking behaviours that promote survival. The objective of this study was to evaluate behaviour and survival of wild versus stocked fingerling (>200 mm) walleye in two Iowa reservoirs. Radio telemetry was used to evaluate walleye movement rates, depth use, home range size, habitat selection and apparent survival. Depth use increased with days since stocking and varied between lake-years but was similar between walleye groups. Daily movement rates varied by the interaction between group and day, with rates declining through time. Home ranges did not differ between groups but were significantly greater in Big Creek than Brushy Creek. Walleye in both lakes generally used habitat in proportion to availability, with few differences between groups detected. Weekly apparent survival ranged from 0.948 to 1.000, varied across lakes, years and seasons, and was higher for stocked than wild walleye in Big Creek but not Brushy Creek. The results indicate that hatchery-reared fingerling walleye behave similar to but can have higher survival than wild fish, suggesting that domestication may not be occurring and that stocking autumn fingerling walleye may help supplement year-class strength.

Fabrication of Two-Dimensional and Three-Dimensional High-Resolution Binder-Free Graphene Circuits Using a Microfluidic Approach for Sensor Applications	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						nanomanufacturing; microfluidics; flexible electronics; graphene; sensors	INKJET-PRINTED GRAPHENE; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; OXIDE; ELECTRODES; FILMS; ADSORPTION; SYSTEMS	In this study, a simple microfluidic method, which can be universally applied to different rigid or flexible substrates, was developed to fabricate high-resolution, conductive, two-dimensional and three-dimensional microstructured graphene-based electronic circuits. The method involves controlled and selective filling of microchannels on substrate surfaces with a conductive binder-free graphene nanoplatelet (GNP) solution. The ethanol-thermal reaction of GNP solution at low temperatures (similar to 75 degrees C) prior to microchannel filling (preheating) can further reduce the GNP andprovide a homogeneous GNP solution, which in turn enhances conductivity, reduces sheet resistance (similar to 0.05 k Omega sq(-1)), enables room-temperature fabrication, and eliminates harsh postprocessing, which makes this fabrication technique compatible with degradable substrates. This method can also be used in combination with 3D printing to fabricate 3D circuits. The feature sizes of the graphene patterns can range from a few micrometers (down to similar to 15 mu m in width and similar to 5 mu m in depth) to a few millimeters and use very small amounts of GNP solution (similar to 2.5 mg of graphene to obtain similar to 0.1 k Omega sq(-1) of sheet resistance for 1 cm(2)). This microfluidic approach can also be implemented using other conductive liquids, such as conductive graphene-silver solutions. This technology has the potential to pave the way for low-cost, disposable, and biodegradable circuits for a range of electronic applications including near-field communication antennas and pressure or strain sensors.

J	Sukhoy, V; Stoytchev, A				Sukhoy, Vladimir; Stoytchev, Alexander			Numerical error analysis of the ICZT algorithm for chirp contours on the unit circle	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							FAST FOURIER-TRANSFORMS; FFT	This paper shows that the inverse chirp z-transform (ICZT), which generalizes the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) off the unit circle in the complex plane, can also be used with chirp contours that perform partial or multiple revolutions on the unit circle. This is done as a special case of the ICZT, which in algorithmic form has the same computational complexity as the IFFT, i.e., O(n log n). Here we evaluate the ICZT algorithm for chirp contours on the unit circle and show that it is numerically accurate for large areas of the parameter space. The numerical error in this case depends on the polar angle between two adjacent contour points.

We developed two resources to address these problems. First, we re-analyzed proteomic data from six species with experimentally characterized mt-proteomes: animals (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster), and outgroups (Acanthamoeba castellanii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and created the Metazoan Mitochondrial Proteome Database (MMPdb) to host the results. Second, we developed a novel pipeline, "MitoPredictor" that uses a Random Forest classifier to infer mitochondrial localization of proteins based on orthology, mitochondrial targeting signal prediction, and protein domain analyses. Both tools generate an R Shiny applet that can be used to visualize and interact with the results and can be used on a personal computer. MMPdb is also available online at https://mmpdb.eeob.iastate.edu/.

Concentration Enrichment, Separation, and Cation Exchange in Nanoliter-Scale Water-in-Oil Droplets	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ION CONCENTRATION POLARIZATION; PRECONCENTRATION; BIOMOLECULE; ASSAY; MICROFLUIDICS; IMPACT; DEVICE	Droplet-based techniques have had a profound impact in chemistry, owing to their ability to perform rapid and massively parallel reactions in minute fluid volumes. In many applications, concentration enrichment is required to increase the speed of reactions or the sensitivity of assays; but in-droplet concentration enrichment remains challenging. Here, we interface electrokinetic concentration polarization with droplet microfluidics to accomplish in-droplet demixing. This result is significant because the concentration of any charged species in the droplet can be enriched and the approach can be readily integrated into existing droplet workflows. Further, we show that such electrokinetic enrichment is rapid, on the order of seconds, and is robust, occurring over a wide parametric space. We further demonstrate electrokinetic separation of two anionic fluorophores within the droplet. Such a capability potentiates the droplet-templated synthesis of particles with gradient composition and the development of mobility-shift assays, which rely on discrimination of multiple species tagged with a single color fluorophore. Finally, by using a calcium-binding dye as an indicator, we demonstrate in-droplet cation exchange. This demonstration of cation exchange in droplets is significant because of its broad applicability to strategies for synthesis and bioassays. These results lay the foundation for new advanced droplet techniques with transformative applications.

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cavitation-based ultrasound histotripsy to destroy these biofilms. In this study, the dependence of biofilm destruction on multiple scan parameters was assessed by conducting exposures at different scan speeds (0.3-1.4 beamwidths/s), step sizes (0.25-0.5 beamwidths), and the number of passes of the focus across the mesh (2-6). For each of the exposure conditions, the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) remaining on the mesh was quantified. A regression analysis was then conducted, revealing that the scan speed was the most critical parameter for biofilm destruction. Reducing the number of passes and the scan speed should allow for more efficient biofilm destruction in the future, reducing the treatment time.

A Technoeconomic Platform for Early-Stage Process Design and Cost Estimation of Joint Fermentative-Catalytic Bioprocessing	PROCESSES			English	Article						SuperPro; early-stage; process modeling; cost analysis; ethanol; sorbic acid	BIOLOGICAL CATALYSIS	Technoeconomic analyses using established tools such as SuperPro Designer(R) require a level of detail that is typically unavailable at the early stage of process evaluation. To facilitate this, members of our group previously created a spreadsheet-based process modeling and technoeconomic platform explicitly aimed at joint fermentative-catalytic biorefinery processes. In this work, we detail the reorganization and expansion of this model-ESTEA2 (Early State Technoeconomic Analysis, version 2), including detailed design and cost calculations for new unit operations. Furthermore, we describe ESTEA2 validation using ethanol and sorbic acid process. The results were compared with estimates from the literature, SuperPro Designer(R) (Version 8.5, Intelligen Inc., Scotch Plains, NJ, 2013), and other third-party process models. ESTEA2 can perform a technoeconomic analysis for a joint fermentative-catalytic process with just 12 user-supplied inputs, which, when modeled in SuperPro Designer(R), required approximately eight additional inputs such as equipment design configurations. With a reduced amount of user information, ESTEA2 provides results similar to those in the literature, and more sophisticated models (ca. 7%-11% different).	[Viswanathan, Mothi Bharath; Raman, D.

The main purpose of our study was to determine whether fungicides affect the microbiome of soybean plants during the pod-fill reproductive stage. In a replicated experiment focused on the impact of a fungicide application including a quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) and a pyrazole-carboxamide spanning two growing seasons, healthy stems and leaves near the tops of soybean were sampled for endophytic fungi. The survey yielded 1,791 isolates belonging to 17 putative species, identified by morphology and sequence analysis of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region. Taxa were grouped by genus into operational taxonomic units: Alternaria, Colletotrichum, and Diaporthe were the dominant genera isolated. Plant parts were analyzed separately using a multivariate community analysis of isolate counts per plant. The 14.3% fluxapyroxad and 28.6% pyraclostrobin fungicide spray significantly increased the proportion of Diaporthe isolates over no-spray controls, whereas the inverse occurred for foliar Alternaria isolates. In addition, seed harvested from fields with shorter-season varieties and sprayed with fungicide showed higher percentages of Diaporthe isolates than fields with no fungicide spray. In conclusion, soybean farmers may want to consider that the application of a QoI fungicide in the absence of disease pressure might adversely impact seed quality.

Array Aware Training/Pruning: Methods for Efficient Forward Propagation on Array-based Neural Network Accelerators	2020 IEEE 31ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLICATION-SPECIFIC SYSTEMS, ARCHITECTURES AND PROCESSORS (ASAP 2020)	IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems Architectures and Processors		English	Proceedings Paper	31st IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)	JUL 06-08, 2020	Univ Manchester, Dept Comp Sci, Manchester, ENGLAND	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc	Univ Manchester, Dept Comp Sci	Array; Deep Neural Networks; Accelerators; Training; Pruning		Due to the increase in the use of large-sized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) over the years, specialized hardware accelerators such as Tensor Processing Unit and Eyeriss have been developed to accelerate the forward pass of the network. The essential component of these devices is an array processor which is composed of multiple individual compute units for efficiently executing Multiplication and Accumulation (MAC) operation. As the size of this array limits the amount of DNN processing of a single layer, the computation is performed in several batches serially leading to extra compute cycles along both the axes. In practice, due to the mismatch between matrix and array sizes, the computation does not map on the array exactly. In this work, we address the issue of minimizing processing cycles on the array by adjusting the DNN model parameters by using a structured hardware array dependent optimization. We introduce two techniques in this paper: Array Aware Training (AAT) for efficient training and Array Aware Pruning (AAP) for efficient inference. Weight pruning is an approach to remove redundant parameters in the network to decrease the size of the network. The key idea behind pruning in this paper is to adjust the model parameters (the weight matrix) so that the array is fully utilized in each computation batch. Our goal is to compress the model based on the size of the array so as to reduce the number of computation cycles. We observe that both the proposed techniques results into similar accuracy as the original network while saving a significant number of processing cycles (75%).

For detecting these transitions during operation, it is of utmost importance to develop an accurate data-driven framework that is robust enough to classify stable and unstable scenarios. In this paper, we propose deep learning frameworks that show remarkable accuracy in the classification task of combustion instability on carefully designed diverse training and test sets. We train our model with data from a laboratory-scale combustion system showing stable and unstable states. The dataset is multimodal with correlated data of hi-speed video and acoustic signals. We develop a labeling mechanism for sequences by implementing Kullback-Leibler Divergence on the time-series data. We develop deep learning frameworks using 3D Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory network for this classification task. To go beyond the accuracy and to gain insights into the predictions, we incorporate attention mechanism across the time-steps. This aids in understanding the time-periods which contribute significantly to the prediction outcome. We validate the insights from a domain knowledge perspective. By exploring inside the accurate black-box models, this framework can be used for the development of better detection frameworks in different dynamical systems. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

It is important to detect milkweed plant locations to assess the status and trends of monarch habitat in support of monarch conservation programs. In this paper, we describe autonomous detection of milkweed plants using cameras mounted to vehicles. For detection, we used both aggregated channel features (ACF) for running the detectors on embedded computing platforms with central processing unit and faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) with a ResNet architecture-based detector that is suitable for graphics processing unit optimized processing. The ACF-based model produced 0.89 mean average precision (mAP) on the training dataset and 0.29 mAP on the test dataset, whereas the ResNet-based Faster R-CNN model provided 0.98 mAP on training and 0.44 mAP on the test dataset. The detections were used to calculate approximate densities of milkweed plants in geo-referenced locations based on global positioning system point correspondences of recorded images. Probability-of-count distributions are compared for the actual milkweed plant locations near roadsides. This is one of the first examples of using automated milkweed plant detection and density mapping using a vehicle-mounted camera.

In order to have a better understanding of the generation and dissipation of PWP during undrained shearing, a novel PWP measurement system was designed to measure PWP at the center of a triaxial specimen. The percentage of plastic and non-plastic fines within the specimens was varied and the specimens were sheared in an undrained triaxial compression test at a constant small strain rate. Factors influencing the strength and the development of PWP (at center and end of specimens) such as relative density, skeletal void ratio, and the fines content along with their plasticity index were investigated.

During these shocks, social capital is a fundamental resource to a resilient community. This research seeks to explore the relationship between social capital and resilience to economic shocks. Using county level data, 2,666 counties experienced an economic shock between 2008 and 2009. A new framework integrating bonding, linking, and bridging social capital provided a theoretical structure using data from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Correlations then were conducted to measure the relationship between various social capital measures and an area's ability to recover following an economic shock. This research expands understanding of community features that lead to economic resilience. Preliminary correlations amongst bonding variables found educational equality and the percent of the population under age 65 as having the strongest positive relationship with economic resiliency. Additionally, the number of religious organizations per 10,000 people and the percent of union membership from the linking variables have a negative relationship with economic resiliency.

J	Winfrey, KL				Winfrey, Kelly L.			"I'm F---ing Moving to Iowa:" Gender and Candidate Image in the 2020 Iowa Caucus	AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST			English	Article						Iowa; 2020 Iowa Caucus; gender; candidate		The 2020 presidential race started in Iowa, like it has since 1972. The slate of candidates was the most diverse ever and included six women. This study examines the relationship between candidates' gender, image, and support among Iowa voters. Iowans have access to candidates that other voters do not, so their perceptions provide unique insight into the construction of candidate images. This study examines the image qualities of leading candidates as perceived by Iowa caucus-goers in the fall of 2019. Using survey data of 576 likely Democratic caucus attendees, I examine the relationship between candidates' gender, image, and support. I find that women candidates did not benefit from stereotypical strengths of honesty and compassion, but they were perceived as strong leaders. I also find evidence of differences in image evaluations based on respondent sex, with women voters rating untraditional candidates higher than men voters.

J	Wong, C; Crystal, K; Coats, J				Wong, Colin; Crystal, Kylie; Coats, Joel			Three molecules found in rosemary or nutmeg essential oils repel ticks (Dermacentor variabilis) more effectively than DEET in a no-human assay	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						repellents; monoterpenoid; phenylpropanoid; natural products; tick&#8208; repellent; pesticide	IXODES-SCAPULARIS ACARI; LABORATORY EVALUATION; PERSONAL PROTECTION; IXODIDAE; PERMETHRIN; EFFICACY	BACKGROUND Development of new personal repellents to prevent tick bites is progressing to keep up with the increasing threat of tick-borne diseases in humans. However, the market share of natural, plant-based repellents is still quite small. We tested all of the major (>1%) components found in the essential oils of rosemary (Spanish variety) and nutmeg. These were tested with Dermacentor variabilis ticks, a robust tick capable of vectoring human diseases, in a no-human horizontal Petri dish assay. For comparison, we also tested the active ingredients currently recommended by the CDC and EPA as personal repellents for use against ticks. RESULTS Of the 16 oil components tested, three performed significantly better than N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) in our assay. These compounds were myristicin and safrole found in the nutmeg oil, and terpinolene found in nutmeg oil and as a minor (<1%) constituent of rosemary oil. The current market natural product, 2-undecanone, also performed strongly in our assay. CONCLUSIONS Our assay focused on comparing active ingredients as potential repellents and found that many natural products can elicit a strong response from ticks. Terpinolene is the most promising active ingredient identified, owing to human health concerns regarding myristicin and safrole. Our results from examining individual terpenoids from two essential oils suggest that there remain unexploited natural compounds that could be further developed for new personal tick repellents.

Studies concerning EA and PD metabolism have primarily focused on bacterial genera from the family Enterobacteriaceae, especially the genus Salmonella. Listeria monocytogenes is a member of the Firmicutes phylum and is the causative agent of the rare but highly fatal foodborne disease listeriosis. The eut, pdu, and cob/cbi operons are organized as a single large locus collectively referred to as the cobalamin-dependent gene cluster (CDGC). The CDGC is well conserved in L. monocytogenes; however, functional characterization of the genes in this cluster and how they may contribute to Listeria virulence and stress tolerance in food production environments is highly limited. Previous work suggests that the degradation pathway of PD is essential for L. monocytogenes establishment in the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, EA metabolism may be more important during intracellular replication. Other studies indicate that the CDGC is utilized when L. monocytogenes is exposed to food and food production relevant stress conditions. Perhaps most noteworthy, L. monocytogenes exhibits attenuated growth at cold temperatures when a key EA utilization pathway gene was deleted. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge of these pathways in L. monocytogenes and their significance in virulence and stress tolerance, especially considering recent developments.

Mechanical degradation due to vacancies produced by grain boundary corrosion of steel	ACTA MATERIALIA			English	Article						Nanoindentation; Atomistic modeling; Grain boundary degradation; Stress corrosion cracking; Vacancies; Dislocation activation volume	EDGE DISLOCATION; RATE SENSITIVITY; HYDROGEN EMBRITTLEMENT; INCIPIENT PLASTICITY; ACTIVATION VOLUME; STRAIN-RATE; STRESS; NANOINDENTATION; DEFORMATION; CRACKING	Ductile alloys fail in corrosive environments by intergranular stress corrosion cracking, through interactions between mechanical and chemical processes that are not yet understood. We investigate formation and mechanical effects of metal defects produced by grain boundary corrosion of low-alloy pipeline steel, at conditions of high susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking in the absence of hydrogen evolution. Nanoindentation measurements show local softening near corroded grain boundaries, indicated by significantly reduced critical loads for dislocation nucleation. Molecular dynamics simulations of nanoindentation of bulk iron showed that metal vacancies and not interstitial hydrogen atoms explain the observed critical load reduction. Both the dislocation activation volume and dislocation activation energy for vacancy-charged samples are found to be nearly one-half of that for a hydrogen charged samples. Quantitative agreement with experimentally measured indentation response was found for vacancy concentrations equivalent to the bulk silicon concentration in the steel, suggesting that vacancies originate from oxidation of reactive silicon solute atoms at grain boundaries. The results help explain the chemical mechanism of formation of vacancy defects that may participate in grain boundary degradation in the absence of hydrogen embrittlement environment.

To achieve this, first, a breadth-first search (BFS)-based mechanism is proposed to decompose the network into a set of zones that maximize outage location information in partially observable systems. Then, using SM data in each zone, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is designed to implicitly extract the temporal-spatial behavior in normal conditions in an unsupervised fashion. After training, an anomaly scoring technique is leveraged to determine if real-time measurements indicate an outage event in the zone. Finally, to infer the location of the outage events in a multi-zone network, a zone coordination process is proposed to take into account the interdependencies of intersecting zones. We have provided analytical guarantees of performance for our algorithm using the concept of entropy, which is leveraged to quantify outage location information in multi-zone grids. The proposed method has been tested and verified on distribution feeder models with real SM data.

Nanoporous gold peel-and-stick biosensors created with etching inkjet maskless lithography for electrochemical pesticide monitoring with microfluidics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							DIRECT ELECTRODEPOSITION; TEAR GLUCOSE; L-CYSTEINE; FABRICATION; LEAF; ARRAYS; NANOPARTICLES; PRETREATMENT; EFFICIENT; FILMS	Nanoporous gold leaf (NPGL) is an attractive material for flexible electrochemical biosensors due its high and tunable surface area, electrical conductivity, biocompatibility/non-reactive nature, and rich surface chemistry. However, NPGL synthesis and patterning protocols are complex, costly and consequently not suited for flexible electronic fabrication. This work develops a new manufacturing technique coined Etching Inkjet Maskless Lithography (E-IML) to synthesize and pattern NPGL and metal leaf materials (thickness similar to 100 nm) for flexible electronics. E-IML utilizes the versatility of an inkjet printer to pattern electrodes for rapid prototyping, even on flexible substrates (polyimide). We demonstrate how NPGL electrodes, with feature and pores sizes down to approximately 25 nm and 5 nm respectively, can be synthesized and patterned from gold/silver leaf material with E-IML and dealloyed (silver removed) via electrochemical etching. Additionally, a pseudo-reference electrode was E-IML patterned from silver leaf and chlorinated with a diluted bleach solution to make a Ag/AgCl electrode for use in 3-electrode electrochemical biosensing with NPGL working and counter electrodes. These 3-electrode electrochemical biosensors were patterned on adhesive polyimide films for use as disposable peel-and-stick tape biosensors or wearable sticker biosensors. In order to demonstrate the utility of the peel-and-stick biosensors, a disposable tape pesticide biosensor and reusable 3D printed flow cell were developed for organophosphate detection in soil samples. Multiple NPGL working electrodes were fabricated on single devices so that that each electrode could be functionalized with distinct concentrations of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Paraoxon (a model organophosphate) sensing results demonstrated a low detection limit (0.53 mu M) and high sensitivity (376 nA nM(-1)). The unique multi-electrode enzyme functionalization protocol allowed for a wider paraoxon sensing range (four orders of magnitude: 1 nM-10 mM) than one electrode alone. The flow cell platform biosensor was also tested in real-world samples (soil slurry) and demonstrated a signal recovery of approximately 93.5% and 91.5% for soil slurry samples spiked with 10 nM and 1 mM paraoxon concentration respectively. Hence these thin-film E-IML NPGL patterning and synthesis techniques could be useful for a wide variety of applications including electrochemical sensors, supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells, energy harvesters, triboelectric nanogenerators, and membranes.

J	Nayer, S; Narayanamurthy, P; Vaswani, N				Nayer, Seyedehsara; Narayanamurthy, Praneeth; Vaswani, Namrata			Provable Low Rank Phase Retrieval	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						Low-rank matrix recovery; phase retrieval (PR); quadratic measurements	SUBSPACE TRACKING; SIGNAL RECOVERY; MISSING DATA; CONVERGENCE; ALGORITHMS; MATRICES	We study the Low Rank Phase Retrieval (LRPR) problem defined as follows: recover an n x q matrix X* of rank r from a different and independent set of m phaseless (magnitude-only) linear projections of each of its columns. To be precise, we need to recover X* from yk := | A(k)' x(k)* |, k = 1, 2, ... , q when the measurement matrices A(k) are mutually independent. Here y(k) is an m length vector, A(k) is an n x m matrix, and ' denotes matrix transpose. The question is when can we solve LRPR with m << n? A reliable solution can enable fast and low-cost phaseless dynamic imaging, e.g., Fourier ptychographic imaging of live biological specimens. In this work, we develop the first provably correct approach for solving this LRPR problem. Our proposed algorithm, Alternating Minimization for Low-Rank Phase Retrieval (AltMinLowRaP), is an AltMin based solution and hence is also provably fast (converges geometrically). Our guarantee shows that AltMinLowRaP solves LRPR to epsilon accuracy, with high probability, as long as mq >= Cnr(4) log(1/epsilon), the matrices A(k) contain i.i.d. standard Gaussian entries, and the right singular vectors of X* satisfy the incoherence assumption from matrix completion literature. Here C is a numerical constant that only depends on the condition number of X* and on its incoherence parameter. Its time complexity is only Cmqnr log(2) (1/epsilon). Since even the linear (with phase) version of the above problem is not fully solved, the above result is also the first complete solution and guarantee for the linear case. Finally, we also develop a simple extension of our results for the dynamic LRPR setting.

They operate by partitioning each job into smaller tasks executed on different servers. The servers also need to exchange intermediate values to complete the computation. Experimental evidence suggests that this so-called Shuffle phase can be a significant part of the overall execution time for several classes of jobs. Prior work has demonstrated a natural tradeoff between computation and communication whereby running redundant copies of jobs can reduce the Shuffle traffic load, thereby leading to reduced overall execution times. For a single job, the main drawback of this approach is that it requires the original job to be split into a number of files that grows exponentially in the system parameters. When extended to multiple jobs (with specific function types), these techniques suffer from a limitation of a similar flavor, i.e., they require an exponentially large number of jobs to be executed. In practical scenarios, these requirements can significantly reduce the promised gains of the method. In this work, we show that a class of combinatorial structures called resolvable designs can be used to develop efficient coded distributed computing schemes for both the single and multiple job scenarios considered in prior work. We present both theoretical analysis and exhaustive experimental results (on Amazon EC2 clusters) that demonstrate the performance advantages of our method. For the single and multiple job cases, we obtain speed-ups of 4.69x (and 2.6x over prior work) and 4.31x over the baseline approach, respectively.

Coupled fluid-solid dynamics of an elastically-mounted rigid circular cylinder are performed using detached eddy simulations with four computational domains of different span lengths. Simulations with span less than five-cylinder diameters give erroneous results including, under/overprediction of displacement amplitude, premature lock-in, etc. Spectra of transverse loading and displacement, instantaneous oscillation frequency, and phase lag between transverse force and displacement are analyzed. High spanwise coherence is found to be the primary cause of the artefacts observed in small-span simulations.

J	Ansarifar, J; Akhavizadegan, F; Wang, LZ				Ansarifar, Javad; Akhavizadegan, Faezeh; Wang, Lizhi			Performance prediction of crosses in plant breeding through genotype by environment interactions	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HYBRID PERFORMANCE; RIDGE-REGRESSION; FOOD SECURITY; YIELD; MAIZE; MODELS; SELECTION	Performance prediction of potential crosses plays a significant role in plant breeding, which aims to produce new crop varieties that have higher yields, require fewer resources, and are more adaptable to the changing environments. In the 2020 Syngenta crop challenge, Syngenta challenged participants to predict the yield performance of a list of potential breeding crosses of inbreds and testers based on their historical yield data in different environments. They released a dataset that contained the observed yields for 294,128 corn hybrids through the crossing of 593 unique inbreds and 496 unique testers across multiple environments between 2016 and 2018. To address this challenge, we designed a new predictive approach that integrates random forest and an optimization model for G x E interaction detection. Our computational experiment found that our approach achieved a relative root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.0869 for the validation data, outperforming other state-of-the-art models such as factorization machine and extreme gradient boosting tree. Our model was also able to detect genotype by environment interactions that are potentially biologically insightful. This model won the first place in the 2020 Syngenta crop challenge in analytics.

The measured spectra were fitted with a Debye relaxation model using a non-linear, weighted, least-squares analysis. Conductivity was measured independently to reduce uncertainty in obtaining other parameters by spectral fitting. Careful experimentation provided dielectric data of sufficiently low uncertainty to enable observation of polarization mechanisms that emerge only in the low-concentration regime. The data were fitted by a concentration-dependent parametric model that includes terms accounting for internal depolarizing fields and the solvent dilution effect (mixture relation), the kinetic depolarization effect, the dielectric saturation effect, and the Debye-Falkenhagen effect that accounts for the contribution of ionic atmosphere polarization. It has been shown that, in NaCl and NaNO3 solutions at sufficiently low concentrations, the static permittivity increases due to the Debye-Falkenhagen effect. It has also been shown that, to calculate the number of irrotationally bound water molecules Z(IB), the measured static permittivity values should be corrected to account for the contributions of kinetic depolarization and Debye-Falkenhagen effects. Otherwise, unrealistic values of Z(IB) are obtained. An explanation for the different strengths of the Debye-Falkenhagen effect observed for the different electrolyte solutions, essentially due to the electrophoretic effect and coordination number, is also presented.

Effect of rumen-protected lysine on growth performance, carcass characteristics, and plasma amino acid profile in feedlot steers	TRANSLATIONAL ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						amino acid; beef cattle; feedlot; growth; rumen-protected lysine	CATTLE; RESPONSES; CHROMATOGRAPHY; METHIONINE; FLUIDS; CORN	The objective of this study was to evaluate growth performance, carcass characteristics, and plasma amino acid profiles of feedlot steers fed rumen-protected Lys. Forty-two Angus-cross steers (304 +/- 25 kg) were blocked by weight and fed treatment diets for 180 d (growing days 0 to 55; finishing days 56 to 180): 1) Lys-deficient diet (CON; n = 12 steers), 2) Lys-adequate diet containing soybean meal (POS; n = 12 steers), or 3) Lys-deficient diet plus supplemental rumen-protected Lys (RPL; AjiPro-L; Ajinomoto Animal Nutrition North America, Eddyville, IA; n = 18 steers). Consecutive day bodyweights (BWs) were recorded to begin and end growing and finishing. Individual steer dry matter intake (DMI) was recorded. Blood was collected on days 0, 56, and 179 for analysis of physiological free amino acids. Steers were harvested on day 180 and carcass characteristics were recorded. Data were analyzed using Proc Mixed of SAS 9.4. Steer was the experimental unit and treatment was the fixed effect for all parameters. Block was a fixed effect for growth performance, feed intake, and carcass data. The day 0 value for each parameter of physiological free amino acids was used as a covariate during analysis. The CON steers had greater BW, average daily gain (ADG), and gain to feed (G:F) at the end of growing (day 56; P <= 0.05) vs. POS and RPL. The CON steers also had greater final BW (P = 0.04) and overall ADG (P = 0.04) than RPL, while POS was intermediate. Carcass characteristics were not different across treatments [hot carcass weight, dressing percent, ribeye area, back fat, kidney/pelvic/heart (KPH) percent, marbling, or calculated yield grade; P >= 0.13]. Plasma urea N was greater in POS steers on days 56 and 179 (P <= 0.04). Plasma Lys and Arg concentrations were greater in POS at day 56 (P <= 0.02); however, there was no difference among treatments for these two variables at day 179 (P >= 0.44). Steers in all treatments had greater DMI than predicted, causing a negative metabolizable Lys balance for all treatments during growing. Though the metabolizable Lys balance was positive for POS and RPL-fed steers during finishing, the increased metabolizable Lys in these treatments may have decreased performance if other amino acids were imbalanced due to increased intakes.

Economic feasibility analysis of commercial formaldehyde-based adhesives	SN APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						Techno-economic analysis (TEA); Urea-formaldehyde adhesive (UF adhesive); Metal oxide pathway; Silver pathway	TECHNOECONOMIC ANALYSIS	Formaldehyde-based adhesives have been used for several decades due to its convenience. In this paper, we aimed to explore the economics of urea-formaldehyde (UF) adhesives that can be used in wood panels. Two formaldehyde production pathways: metal oxide pathway and silver pathway, were compared in this study. SuperPro Designer v9.5 software was employed to perform the techno-economic analysis (TEA). Key parameters of TEA were calculated and compared of these two pathways, including total capital investment, annual operating cost and product revenues. It was found that the unit production cost of UF adhesive made from metal oxide pathway ($0.86/kg) was less expensive than that from silver pathway ($0.99/kg), but the total capital cost was slightly higher in metal oxide pathway (40 million $) than silver pathway (38 million $). Additionally, sensitivity analysis indicated that final product yield and material costs were the most sensitive factors among all inputs.

This study reports the effects of physicochemical properties of two distinct biochars on AD of municipal sludge: one was produced from pyrolysis of raw corn stover (BC-1); the other was produced from sulfuric acid pretreatment of the same corn stover (BC-2). BC-1 had higher carbon content, alkalinity, and specific surface area but lower ash and sulfur than BC-2. Both biochars contained volatile fatty acids and residual sugars serving as substrates for anaerobic bacteria to enhance biogas/methane production. When the biochars were added to the AD, their effects on biogas production showed contrary trends. Addition of BC-1 resulted in higher methane yield and content, while BC-2 reduced methane yield and content. The strong buffering capacity of BC-1 was a major factor for its beneficial effect, while the high sulfur content of BC-2 was inhibitory to anaerobic bacteria. Collectively, the results indicated that the effects of biochar on AD depends on biochar properties, and selection of appropriate biochar was important in facilitating higher biogas production and maintaining a stable process.

Recovery of Encapsulated Adult Neural Progenitor Cells from Microfluidic-Spun Hydrogel Fibers Enhances Proliferation and Neuronal Differentiation	ACS OMEGA			English	Article							ELECTROSPUN FIBROUS SCAFFOLDS; STEM-CELLS; ALGINATE HYDROGELS; CALCIUM ALGINATE; DRUG-DELIVERY; MICROFIBERS; ALIGNMENT; SURVIVAL; CULTURE; DESIGN	Because of the limitations imposed by traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures, biomaterials have become a major focus in neural and tissue engineering to study cell behavior in vitro. 2D systems fail to account for interactions between cells and the surrounding environment; these cell-matrix interactions are important to guide cell differentiation and influence cell behavior such as adhesion and migration. Biomaterials provide a unique approach to help mimic the native microenvironment in vivo. In this study, a novel microfluidic technique is used to encapsulate adult rat hippocampal stem/ progenitor cells (AHPCs) within alginate-based fibrous hydrogels. To our knowledge, this is the first study to encapsulate AHPCs within a fibrous hydrogel. Alginate-based hydrogels were cultured for 4 days in vitro and recovered to investigate the effects of a 3D environment on the stem cell fate. Post recovery, cells were cultured for an additional 24 or 72 h in vitro before fixing cells to determine if proliferation and neuronal differentiation were impacted after encapsulation. The results indicate that the 3D environment created within a hydrogel is one factor promoting AHPC proliferation and neuronal differentiation (19.1 and 13.5%, respectively); however, this effect is acute. By 72 h post recovery, cells had similar levels of proliferation and neuronal differentiation (10.3 and 8.3%, respectively) compared to the control conditions. Fibrous hydrogels may better mimic the natural micro-environment present in vivo and be used to encapsulate AHPCs, enhancing cell proliferation and selective differentiation. Understanding cell behavior within 3D scaffolds may lead to the development of directed therapies for central nervous system repair and rescue.

Development and characterization of a novel soy lecithin-stearic acid and whey protein concentrate bigel system for potential edible applications	FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS			English	Article						Bigel; Oleogel emulsion; Hydrogel; Soy lecithin; Stearic acid; Whey protein concentrate	DELIVERY; OIL; ORGANOGELS; OLEOGELS; EMULSIONS; HYDROGELS; MIXTURES; BEHAVIOR; FATS	Bigels are a new technology with great potential in the food industry. Their success with drug delivery suggests they may be able to deliver sensitive compounds in foods, such as probiotics and bioactives. The purpose of this study was to develop and characterize a novel, edible bigel system. The bigel was prepared by homogenizing, at high shear, an oleogel emulsion composed of soy lecithin, stearic acid, soybean oil, and water, and a hydrogel composed of whey protein concentrate and water. Characterization was conducted through small angle x-ray scattering, rheology, and fluorescence microscopy. With addition of the hydrogel component, the oleogel emulsion retained its basic structural characteristics, but lost higher order structuring. The bigels were found to have temperature-dependent G' values. Despite temperature sensitivity, the bigels showed G' >G '' at all temperatures from 8 to 98 degrees C. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that a bi-continuous bigel was formed at equal proportions of oleogel emulsion and hydrogel; nevertheless, when either of those phases increased one of them became the dominant continuous phase. Some interaction between the phases may have occurred at 10 wt% water and 15 wt% protein usage in the oleogel emulsion and hydrogel, respectively, and this synergy improved the bigel's mechanical properties. On the contrary, at protein and water contents outside those listed above, the relationship between phases became antagonistic towards the bigel's mechanical properties.

A combination of covalent and noncovalent binding groups in the hydrophobic core of water-soluble nanoparticles enabled them to recognize dopamine and epinephrine with an association constant (K-a) of 3-4x10(4) M-1 in water, an order of magnitude higher than those of previously reported synthetic hosts. In addition, minute structural changes among analogues were detected including the addition or removal of a single hydroxyl or methyl group.

These, however, have not often been directly compared. Emerging adults contemplated one technique for 12 min while walking around a building. Those who wished others well (loving-kindness) had lower anxiety, greater happiness, greater empathy, and higher feelings of caring and connectedness than those in a control condition. The Interconnectedness condition resulted only in beneficial effects on social connection. Although social comparison theory suggests that downward social comparison should improve mood, this study found that it had no beneficial effects relative to the control condition and was significantly worse than the loving-kindness condition. This brief loving-kindness contemplation worked equally well across several measured individual differences, and is a simple intervention that can be used to reduce anxiety, increase happiness, empathy, and feelings of social connection.

Fats and oils may be added to low-starch diets to meet energy requirements, but little is known about its effects on canine health. The study objective was to evaluate the effects of feeding healthy adult dogs low carbohydrate, high-fat diets on apparent total tract digestibility, fecal characteristics, and overall health status. Eight adult Beagles were enrolled in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin Square design feeding trial. Dogs were randomly assigned to one of four dietary fat level treatments (T) within each period: 32% (T1), 37% (T2), 42% (T3), and 47% (T4) fat on a dry matter basis. Fat levels were adjusted with the inclusion of canola oil added to a commercial diet. Each dog was fed to exceed its energy requirement based on NRC (2006). Blood samples were analyzed for complete blood counts, chemistry profiles, and canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity levels. Apparent total tract digestibility improved (P < 0.05) as the fat level increased for dry matter, organic matter, fat, and gross energy. Fecal output decreased as levels of fat increased in the diet (P = 0.002). There was no effect of fat level on stool quality or short-chain fatty acid and ammonia concentrations in fecal samples (P >= 0.20). Blood urea nitrogen levels decreased with increased fat level (P = 0.035). No significant differences were seen in canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (P = 0.110). All blood parameters remained within normal reference intervals. In summary, increased dietary fat improved apparent total tract digestibility, did not alter fecal characteristics, and maintained the health status of all dogs.	[Kilburn, Logan R.; Serao, Mariana C.

Pyrone Esters (PEs) of varying carbon chain lengths were synthesized by reacting coumalic acid chloride with alcohols. Chemical composition was verified via NMR and mass spectroscopy while rheological behavior was characterized with a parallel plate rheometer. In comparison, a commercially available monoester was tested. For friction and wear testing, all additives were blended at 1% by weight into a mineral base oil. Neat oil served as the control. A custom reciprocating microtribometer and temperature controlled stage was used to generate wear scars and record the time-evolving friction response. Results showed that the addition of certain PEs reduced friction by up to 25% and mitigated wear by up to 60% in comparison to the neat oil. Subsequently, PE demonstrated its superb potential as an environmentally friendly base stock or lubricant additive.

Specifically, the role of interparental conflict, harsh parenting, and microaggressions on psychological perpetration and victimization are assessed. This study includes 379 GLBTQ individuals and findings from structural equation modeling illustrate that although mother interparental conflict, mother harsh parenting, and microaggressions were all significantly correlated with psychological victimization and perpetration, once all variables were added to the model, only microaggressions were significantly positively associated with both perpetration and victimization of psychological violence. Also, moderation by participant gender and if the participant was out to a parent or not was not supported. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

Distinguishing between common cause variation and special cause variation in a manufacturing system: A simulation of decision making for different types of variation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Common cause variation; Special cause variation; Control charts; Decision making; Simulation; Manufacturing system	STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL; CONTROL CHART; MEAN SHIFTS; RECOGNITION; IMPROVEMENT; REDUCTION; TOOL	Controlling variation is an important aspect of quality improvement. Deming distinguishes between common cause variation and special cause variation and argues that both types of variation frequently result from people participating in the process. Confusing common cause and special cause variation can lead to incorrect decisions. This article analyzes the impact of an individual's ability to distinguish between common cause and special cause variation by simulating a manufacturing system with several human operators and a production manager. We use a recognition primed decision (RPD) model to simulate how human operators and the production manager would interpret the variation and make decisions to reduce the variation. A shared mental model with the RPD framework describes the interactions between different operators and the production manager. Results from this simulation demonstrate the importance of distinguishing between common cause and special cause variation, especially when problems occur at bottleneck points in the manufacturing system.

To ensure the integrity, many PFSes are designed with a checker component, which serves as the last line of defense to bring a corrupted PFS back to a healthy state. Motivated by real-world incidents of PFS corruptions, we perform a fine-grained study on the capability of PFS checkers in this paper. We apply type-aware fault injection to specific PFS structures, and examine the detection and repair policies of PFS checkers meticulously via a well-defined taxonomy. The study results on two representative PFS checkers show that they are able to handle a wide range of corruptions on important data structures. On the other hand, neither of them is perfect: there are multiple cases where the checkers may behave sub-optimally, leading to kernel panics, wrong repairs, etc. Our work has led to a new patch on Lustre. We hope to develop our methodology into a generic framework for analyzing the checkers of diverse PFSes, and enable more elegant designs of PFS checkers for reliable high-performance computing.

Composition and inclusion of probiotics in broiler diets alter intestinal permeability and spleen immune cell profiles without negatively affecting performance	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						broiler; gut integrity; immune cell profile; performance; probiotic	LACTOBACILLUS-PLANTARUM; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; BACTERIAL TRANSLOCATION; MICROBIOTA; CHICKENS; STRAIN; SUPPLEMENTATION; MICROFLORA; MORPHOLOGY; ENERGY	Probiotic feed additives with potential to enhance performance, health, and immunity have gained considerable popularity in commercial broiler production. The study objectives were to measure broiler performance, gut integrity, and splenic immune cell profiles in birds fed one of two probiotics at two inclusion levels. Nine hundred sixty Ross 708 broilers (12 per pen) were randomly assigned to no additive control, 0.05% or 0.10% LactoCare (Lactobacillus reuteri), or 0.05% or 0.10% LactoPlan (Lactobacillus plantarum) dietary treatments for 6 wk. On day 27, a 20-pen subset was utilized for a fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) assay, where half of the pens were subject to a 12-h feed restriction (FR) pregavage. Serum collected from blood drawn 1-h postgavage was analyzed for relative fluorescence of FITC-d absorbed across the intestinal barrier as a gut leakiness indicator. On day 42, spleens from eight birds per treatment were collected for immune cell profile analysis by multicolor flow cytometry. Although performance outcomes were not affected by dietary treatment, FITC-d absorption post-FR was increased 57% in the 0.05% LactoPlan treatment, and was decreased by 12.6% in the 0.05% LactoCare diet, 12% in the 0.10% LactoCare diet, and 22% in the 0.10% LactoPlan diet compared with the control. This indicates a positive impact in barrier integrity maintenance due to 0.05% and 0.10% LactoCare and 0.10% LactoPlan diet following a challenge. Immune cell profiles varied between the two probiotic compositions, with an approximately 50% reduction in splenic innate immune cells (monocyte/macrophage(+)) in birds fed LactoPlan (P < 0.0001) and greater overall percentages of CD45(+) leukocytes and CD3(+) T cells in birds fed 0.10% LactoCare (P < 0.0001). LactoPlan diets shifted splenic T-cell populations in favor of CD8 alpha(+) cytotoxic T cells (T-C; P = 0.007), while higher inclusions (0.10%) of either probiotic increased the percentage of activated CD4(+) helper T cells (T-H; P < 0.0001). These results indicate that compositionally different probiotics had varying effects on the gut permeability and splenic immune cell profiles in broiler chickens, particularly at higher inclusion rates, but observed changes to underlying physiology did not negatively impact performance outcomes. The ability of a probiotic to alter gut permeability and immune cell profile, therefore, may depend on the compositional complexity of the product as well as inclusion rate.

To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid machine learning model that combines a shallow learning model, relevance vector machine (RVM), and a deep learning model, convolutional neural network (CNN). RVM is employed to generate artificial cells with high cycle lives, expanding the original training dataset (i.e., data augmentation). The expanded training dataset then serves as the input-output pairs used to train the CNN model. CNN first learns the locally-invariant features from the input data and then makes full use of these features to predict the cycle life of a Li-ion battery cell. We evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid machine learning (RVM+CNN) model on two test datasets consisting of 83 cells with widely varying cycle lives ranging from 150 to 2300 cycles. The RVM+CNN model produces higher cycle life prediction accuracy on both datasets than three other machine learning and deep learning methods.

This water, combined with cutting residue, generates a high pH and high alkaline slurry byproduct referred to as concrete grinding residue (CGR). Although spreading CGR along roadsides is one of the most commonly used disposal methods, it is always of concern because of its potential effect on roadside soil properties. A field study was therefore conducted in 2016 on two roadside slopes beside Highway I-90 in Minnesota on which CGR slurries were offloaded in 2009 and 2013, respectively. The chemical properties of soils that received this CGR were measured and compared with those of adjacent soils that had not received CGR. The areas after receiving CGR slurry exhibited that pH reduced by 0.78 while electrical conductivity (EC) and calcium concentration increased by 0.48 ds m(-1) and 97 mg kg(-1), respectively. Because spreading of CGR did not cause any perceptible reduction in soil quality, CGR was not deemed to be of long-term concern with respect to roadside environments.

RNA Extraction from Swine Samples and Detection of Influenza A Virus in Swine by Real-Time RT-PCR	ANIMAL INFLUENZA VIRUS, 3 EDITION: Methods and Protocols	Methods in Molecular Biology		English	Article; Book Chapter						Swine influenza A virus; RNA extraction; Real-time RT-PCR; Virus detection; Subtyping	PIGS; POPULATIONS; H3N1	Real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assays are currently the method of choice in many laboratories for the detection and subtyping of influenza A virus (IAV) in swine. Traditionally, nasal swabs and lung tissues (sometimes bronchoalveolar lavage and tracheal tissues) are the primary specimens for IAV testing. However, oral fluids are becoming more common for IAV prognostic profiling. In this chapter, we describe (1) procedures of RNA extraction from the common clinical specimens, (2) two rRT-PCR assays for detection of IAV in swine, and (3) an rRT-PCR assay for subtyping swine IAV. RNA extraction procedures include a magnetic bead method optimized for extraction from nasal swabs and tissue homogenates and a magnetic bead method optimized for extraction from oral fluids. Two rRT-PCR assays for detection of swine IAV include a USDA-validated IAV rRT-PCR targeting the matrix gene and the USDA-licensed VetMAXT-Gold Swine Influenza Virus Detection rRT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) targeting the nucleoprotein and matrix genes. The swine IAV subtyping assay described here is VetMAXT-Gold Swine Influenza Virus Subtyping rRT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) which distinguishes swine IAV H1 from H3 and N1 from N2.

Evaluation of Cognitive Skill Degradation in Flight Planning	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE ENGINEERING AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article						cognitive processes; applied cognitive task analysis; aviation; information automation	AUTOMATION; RETENTION	This work aimed to identify cognitive skills associated with flight planning, suggest which skills might be susceptible to skill degradation, and investigate the effects of cognitive skill degradation over time. Information automation systems offload cognitive tasks to reduce workload and error. However, the same phenomena seen with physical skill degradation in highly automated aircrafts may also occur when automating cognitive tasks. Two studies were conducted. An applied cognitive task analysis identified cognitive skills in flight planning. An empirical evaluation examined whether some of those skills were susceptible to cognitive skill degradation over time when using automation. Participants were placed into three groups. After conducting a flight planning task manually, groups differed in the next three practice trials: manual, alternating between manual and automation, or only with automation. Finally, all groups conducted the task manually again. Trials were separated by 2 weeks. The automation group showed the most performance degradation and highest workload, while the manual group showed the least performance degradation and least workload. Automation use did not provide the practice needed to mitigate cognitive skill degradation. Analysis of the impacts of information automation on cognitive performance is a first step in understanding the root causes of errors and developing mitigations.

The pre-history of the communist future in Czechoslovakia: Case studies in architecture and revolutionary socialism before 1948	JOURNAL OF MODERN EUROPEAN HISTORY			English	Article						Avant-garde; Czechoslovakia; Hannes Meyer; housing; Karel Teige; Marxism		Scholars have recently written about the importance of Marxism and political agitation within architectural discourses of post-war East Central Europe. Less attention has been paid to the period before World War II and the ways in which Marxist language and concepts were already infused into interwar avant-garde practices and debates. This essay argues that a necessary corrective to this gap in the historiography is to write new histories of interwar revolutionary socialist architecture that do not presuppose the failures of the socialist project itself. These histories emerge from a time in Europe when Marxism offered an enticing alternative vision of the future in a region where economic and social deprivation was real and urgent. Three case studies in Czechoslovakia will be discussed: Karel Teige's engagement with Hannes Meyer, the discourse of the Architectural Working Group, and early experimentation with the collective housing typology in Litvinov, Prague, and Zlin.

The influence of dietary energy and zinc source and concentration on performance, trace mineral status, and gene expression of beef steers	TRANSLATIONAL ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						beef cattle; dietary energy; growth; metallothionein; zinc	AMINO-ACID COMPLEX; COMBINED TRENBOLONE ACETATE; SUPPLEMENTAL ZINC; RELATIVE BIOAVAILABILITY; CARCASS CHARACTERISTICS; NITROGEN-RETENTION; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; RACTOPAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE; INTESTINAL PERMEABILITY; BLOOD METABOLITES	The objective of this study was to determine the effects of increased supplemental Zn from differing sources on growth performance of steers fed diets differing in net energy. Angus steers (n = 72, 324 +/- 2.1 kg) with Genemax gain scores of 3, 4, or 5 were blocked by BW and stratified by Genemax gain score into 12 pens of 6 steers each for 158 d. Pens were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 Zn treatments (ZNTRT): 1) control (no supplemental Zn, analyzed 33 mg Zn/kg DM; CON); 2) inorganic Zn (CON + 120 mg supplemental Zn/kg DM as ZnSO 4 for entire trial; INZN); or 3) 120 mg supplemental Zn/kg DM as Zn-amino acid complex (Availa-Zn; Zinpro, Eden Prairie, MN) for first 60 d, then a blend of ZnSO4 and Zn-AA complex (CON + 60 mg supplemental Zn/kg DM as ZnSO4 + 60 mg supplemental Zn/kg DM as Zn-amino acid complex) for the remainder of the trial (ZNBLD). Two dietary energy strategies (ENERGY) were formulated to reach ADG rates of 1) 1.6 kg/d (LE) or 2) 2.0 kg/d (HE) utilizing a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement (12 steers/treatment). All steers were fed LE for a 60 d growing period, then pens were randomly assigned to ENERGY treatments fed the remaining 91 d. Day 60 BW tended to be greater (P = 0.07) in steers receiving supplemental Zn vs. CON. Liver Cu was decreased in Zn supplemented steers vs. CON (P = 0.02). Liver Zn concentrations on d 56 did not differ for Zn vs. CON (P = 0.22) nor were there differences due to Zn source (P = 0.98). There were or tended to be ZNTRT x ENERGY effects for d 67-90 ADG and G:F (P <= 0.01), and d 122 BW and d 90-122 G:F (P <= 0.10) driven by improved performance for ZNBLD-HE over ZNBLD-LE, while ENERGY within CON and INZN did not differ. Day 90-122 ADG, overall ADG and overall G:F was greater (P <= 0.02) and d 67-90 G:F tended to be greater (P = 0.10) for HE vs. LE. No ZNTRT x ENERGY or ZNTRT effects were detected for HCW, REA, BF, KPH, MS, or YG (P >= 0.37) while HE increased HCW, BF, MS, and YG compared with LE (P <= 0.05). In the liver, ZNTRT affected d 97 MT1A expression (P = 0.03) where INZN was greater than ZNBLD or CON (P <= 0.02), while ZIP14 was unaffected due to ZNTRT, ENERGY, or the interaction (P = 0.39). Supplying supplemental Zn as ZNBLD during the transition period appeared to improve performance measures, but no final performance advantages were noted due to increased supplemental Zn, regardless of source. Additionally, differences in liver MT1A expression may indicate differing post-absorptive metabolism between Zn sources.

Self-Assembly of Poly(styrene-block-acrylated epoxidized soybean oil) Star-Brush-Like Block Copolymers	MACROMOLECULES			English	Article							ORDER-DISORDER TRANSITION; MICROPHASE-SEPARATION; MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; DIBLOCK COPOLYMERS; CROSS-LINKING; POLYDISPERSITY; MORPHOLOGIES; PHASE; POLYMERS; THERMODYNAMICS	Here we report dynamic and thermodynamic aspects of the self-assembly in a series of branched-chain soybean-oil-derived styrenic block copolymers produced via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. These biobased materials display unusual domain expansion which has not been seen in conventional petroleum-based block copolymers. The chain architecture of poly(styrene-b-acrylated epoxidized soybean oil) (PS-PAESO) block copolymers varies from star-like to star-brush-like owing to the bulk and multifunctionality of the PAESO repeat unit. The self-assembly behavior is evaluated through a combination of (ultra) small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic shear rheology. Microphase separation in PS-PAESO is kinetically limited due to sluggish chain dynamics that cannot be thermally accelerated due to interference from cross-linking reactions. Selective hydrogenation of the residual PAESO vinyl groups retards but does not eliminate cross-linking reactions, indicating that transesterification is also at play. SAXS experiments show that the PS-PAESO domain size scales nearly linearly with the number of statistical segments, with structures as large as d = 155 nm observed. We believe that domain dilation is related to bulky aliphatic side chains in PAESO domains that extend the primary chain backbone to produce a brush-like conformation. The understanding of the structure-property relationships of these new biobased block copolymers gives insights on the design of novel polymer architectures benefiting new applications.

The advantages of circular over linear polarization, mainly that the crack detection is not dependent on the relative orientation of the crack, is discussed. A technique to extract the orientation of a detected crack using SAR images is presented, where the phase difference between the left- and right-hand circular polarizations (LHCP and RHCP) images is used for this purpose. The orientation estimation error introduced by a nonzero crack width is discussed and demonstrated through simulation, and a technique to overcome this error is proposed and demonstrated. The effect of the axial ratio on orientation error is also studied. Subsequently, a dual-circularly polarized antenna was designed, fabricated, and used to image several metal samples containing narrow electrical discharge machining (EDM) notches and real cracks, by which the detection and orientation estimation techniques are successfully demonstrated.

Drivers of Bridge Decommissioning in the United States	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Extending the useful life of bridges through better design, construction, and management is a shared effort among the bridge management community. Data in the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) is valuable for understanding the behavior of bridges throughout their service lives. While the primary reason for bridge replacement, intuitively, would be condition, research has indicated that bridge replacement may not necessarily be driven by the condition of the bridge. The estimated median service life for bridges, 53years, is much lower than the desired service life of 75years. This paper summarizes the results of an NCHRP Project which identified the main drivers for bridge decommissioning in the United States, based on findings from three complementary analyses using historic NBI data files, select agency records, and data from old and new structure pairs. A common finding in previous studies was that a significant portion (15-30%) of decommissioning could not be associated with any particular reason. Although poor condition is a significant factor, the major driver of bridge decommissioning is functional improvement, and this explains the majority of the unexplained cases. Structures replaced due to functional reasons tend to be replaced at a younger age, leading to a decrease in the overall decommissioning age. While decisions on functional improvement projects are not led by bridge offices, bridge networks are substantially affected by these decisions. Coordinating functional improvement decisions at the agency level and integrating relevant information with decision support tools can improve financial planning and asset management processes.

A.; Rover, Diane T.; Darr, Matthew J.; Just, John			Generalizable semi-supervised learning method to estimate mass from sparsely annotated images	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Semi-supervised learning; Computer vision; Mass flow estimation; DNN; Video processing		Mass flow estimation is of great importance to several industries, and it can be quite challenging to obtain accurate estimates due to limitation in expense or general infeasibility. In the context of agricultural applications, yield monitoring is a key component to precision agriculture and mass flow is the critical factor to measure. Measuring mass flow allows for field productivity analysis, cost minimization, and adjustments to machine efficiency. Methods such as volume or force-impact have been used to measure mass flow; however, these methods are limited in application and accuracy. In this work, we use deep learning to develop and test a vision system that can accurately estimate the mass of sugarcane while running in real-time on a sugarcane harvester during operation. The deep learning algorithm that is used to estimate mass flow is trained using very sparsely annotated images (semi-supervised) using only final load weights (aggregated weights over a certain period of time). The deep neural network (DNN) succeeds in capturing the mass of sugarcane accurately and surpasses older volumetric-based methods, despite highly varying lighting and material colors in the images. The deep neural network is initially trained to predict mass on laboratory data (bamboo) and then transfer learning is utilized to apply the same methods to estimate mass of sugarcane. Using a vision system with a relatively lightweight deep neural network we are able to estimate mass of bamboo with an average error of 4.5% and 5.9% for a select season of sugarcane.

J	Zhang, N; Alipour, A				Zhang, Ning; Alipour, Alice			Two-Stage Model for Optimized Mitigation and Recovery of Bridge Network with Final Goal of Resilience	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							FRAMEWORK; ENHANCE; IMPACT; RISK	Ensuring resilience of critical infrastructure systems when facing disruptions is of great importance to engineers, stakeholders, and decision makers. Providing an optimal strategy for strengthening infrastructure system performance before disruption and rapidly recovering systems after disruption are two visible approaches to enhance system resilience efficiently. However, because of the complexity of the interrelationship among system infrastructures and the budgetary limitation, there is an imperative requirement for a rigorous decision-making process to track the costs induced by any enhancement to the system. To address this issue, in this paper, a multiobjective and two-stage stochastic programming model was developed for minimizing network-level cost and mean risk by considering both pre- and post-event maintenance actions. To account for the effects of different improvement strategies on network resilience, this model was tested under various disruption scenarios that highlighted the hazard uncertainty by combining a variety of occurrence probabilities. In this model, pre-event activities represent bridge retrofit that could contribute to increasing robustness and redundancy of the network system, whereas post-event activities are bridge repair and recovery on the basis of the resilience-enhancing effects advanced by the pre-event actions. The consequential optimization is the optimal social-economic outcome that considers different construction and disruption scenarios, and indirect costs associated with the system.

While much of the research on Latino youth takes place in urban schools, this qualitative, interview-based study examines the experiences of three Latino youth who attend a suburban high school in the Midwest. Latino youth in suburbia are not only subject to disciplinary measures that fuel their disconnection with school but must also wrestle with being told that they are not taking advantage of their school's resources. This different sort of policing around resources problematically holds Latino youth accountable for their supposed "shortcomings." This project considers what Latino youth's experiences can teach schools about how to enact asset-driven responses that empower rather than marginalize them.

Does demolishing these distressed houses increase nearby homeowner's maintenance investment? In this paper, I examine these questions by testing whether exposure to targeted demolitions of abandoned and distressed housing affects changes in the external condition of nearby houses. Using two waves of a property inventory in Cleveland, Ohio, my models suggest that, compared with a control group of houses located near vacant housing, proximity to demolitions decreases the likelihood that a property's condition deteriorated between 2015 and 2018 and increases the likelihood that it improved.

While the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine blades with ice accretion has received considerable research attention, few studies have investigated the structural impact of blade ice accretion. This work proposes an adaptable projection-based method to superimpose complex ice configurations onto a baseline structure. The proposed approach provides an efficient methodology to include ice accretion in the high-fidelity isogeometric shell analysis of a realistic wind turbine blade. Linear vibration and nonlinear deflection analyses of the blade are performed for various ice configurations to demonstrate the impact of different ice accretion distributions on structural performance. These analyses indicate decreases in the blade natural frequencies and deflection under icing conditions. Such ice-induced changes clearly reveal the need for structural design consideration for turbines operating under icing conditions.

Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Synthase Utilizes Multiple Acyl Carrier Protein Isoforms(1)([OPEN])	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							PLANT; EXPRESSION; ISOFORMS; TRANSFERASE; DISCOVERY; PATHWAY	Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a highly conserved cofactor protein that is required by Type II fatty acid synthases (FASs). Here, we demonstrate that up to three mitochondrial ACP (mtACP) isoforms support the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mitochondrially localized Type II FAS. The physiological importance of the three mtACPs was evaluated by characterizing the single, double, and triple mutants. ThemtACP1(At2g44620),mtACP2(At1g65290), andmtACP3(At5g47630) single mutants showed no discernible morphological growth phenotype. Functional redundancy among the three mtACPs was indicated by the embryo-lethal phenotype associated with simultaneous loss of all threemtACPgenes. Characterization of all double mutant combinations revealed that although themtacp1 mtacp3andmtacp2 mtacp3double mutant combinations showed no observable growth defect, themtacp1 mtacp2double mutant was viable but displayed delayed growth, reduced levels of posttranslationally lipoylated mitochondrial proteins, hyperaccumulation of photorespiratory Gly, and reduced accumulation of many intermediates in central metabolism. These alterations were partially reversed when themtacp1 mtacp2double mutant plants were grown in a nonphotorespiratory condition (i.e. 1% CO(2)atmosphere) or in the presence of 2% Suc. In summary, mtACP, as a key component of mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthesis, is important in generating the fatty acid precursor of lipoic acid biosynthesis. Thus, the incomplete lipoylation of mitochondrial proteins inmtacpmutants, particularly Gly decarboxylase, affects the recovery of photorespiratory carbon, and this appears to be critical during embryogenesis. Three partially redundant acyl carrier protein isoforms support mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthesis.

Generalized hydrodynamic analysis of transport through a finite open nanopore for two-component single-file systems	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							LATTICE-GAS MODELS; TRACER DIFFUSION; CATALYTIC-REACTION; ZEOLITE MEMBRANES; SURFACE-REACTIONS; SIMULATION; PERMEATION	Single-file diffusion (SFD) in finite open nanopores is characterized by nonzero spatially varying tracer diffusion coefficients within a generalized hydrodynamic description. This contrasts with infinite SFD systems where tracer diffusivity vanishes. In standard tracer counterpermeation (TCP) analysis, two reservoirs, each containing a different species, are connected to opposite ends of a finite pore. We implement an extended TCP analysis to allow the two reservoirs to contain slightly different mixtures of the two species. Then, determination of diffusion fluxes through the pore allows extraction of diffusion coefficients for near-constant partial concentrations of the two species. This analysis is applied for a lattice-gas model describing two-component SFD through a finite linear pore represented by a one-dimensional array of cells. Two types of particles, A and B, can hop only to adjacent empty cells with generally different rates, h(A) and h(B). Particles are noninteracting other than exclusion of multiple cell occupancy. Results reveal generalized hydrodynamic tracer diffusion coefficients which adopt small values inversely proportional to pore length in the pore center, but which are strongly enhanced near pore openings.

Teleporting through virtual environments: Effects of path scale and environment scale on spatial updating	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	27th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (IEEE VR)	MAR 22-26, 2020	Atlanta, GA	IEEE		Legged locomotion; Visualization; Task analysis; Navigation; Space exploration; Virtual environments; Cognition; Navigation; Spatial cognition; Virtual reality; Teleporting	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; INTEGRATION; COMBINATION; ORIENTATION; NAVIGATION; POSITION; SKILLS; CUES	Virtual reality systems typically allow users to physically walk and turn, but virtual environments (VEs) often exceed the available walking space. Teleporting has become a common user interface, whereby the user aims a laser pointer to indicate the desired location, and sometimes orientation, in the VE before being transported without self-motion cues. This study evaluated the influence of rotational self-motion cues on spatial updating performance when teleporting, and whether the importance of rotational cues varies across movement scale and environment scale. Participants performed a triangle completion task by teleporting along two outbound path legs before pointing to the unmarked path origin. Rotational self-motion reduced overall errors across all levels of movement scale and environment scale, though it also introduced a slight bias toward under-rotation. The importance of rotational self-motion was exaggerated when navigating large triangles and when the surrounding environment was large. Navigating a large triangle within a small VE brought participants closer to surrounding landmarks and boundaries, which led to greater reliance on piloting (landmark-based navigation) and therefore reduced-but did not eliminate-the impact of rotational self-motion cues. These results indicate that rotational self-motion cues are important when teleporting, and that navigation can be improved by enabling piloting.

In this paper, we design, analyze, and numerically validate a second order unconditional positivity-preserving scheme for solving a reduced PNP system, which can well approximate the three dimensional ion channel problem. Positivity of numerical solutions is proven to hold true independent of the size of time steps and the choice of the Poisson solver. The scheme is easy to implement without resorting to any iteration method. Several numerical examples further confirm the positivity-preserving property, and demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed scheme, as well as the fast approach to steady states.

J	Pham, H; Olafsson, S				Hieu Pham; Olafsson, Sigurdur			On Cesaro Averages for Weighted Trees in the Random Forest	JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION			English	Article						Classification; Machine learning; Random forest		The random forest is a popular and effective classification method. It uses a combination of bootstrap resampling and subspace sampling to construct an ensemble of decision trees that are then averaged for a final prediction. In this paper, we propose a potential improvement on the random forest that can be thought of as applying a weight to each tree before averaging. The new method is motivated by the potential instability of averaging predictions of trees that may be of highly variable quality, and because of this, we replace the regular average with a Cesaro average. We provide both a theoretical analysis that gives exact conditions under which the new approach outperforms the traditional random forest, and numerical analysis that shows the new approach is competitive when training a classification model on numerous realistic data sets.

Cultivar Selection and Placement of Shadecloth on Midwest High Tunnels Affects Colored Bell Pepper Yield, Fruit Quality, and Plant Growth	HORTSCIENCE			English	Article						black shadecloth; Capsicum annuum; leaf area; soluble solids concentration (SSC); SPAD; total titratable acidity (TTA)	BLOSSOM-END ROT; ANNUM L. CROP; SWEET-PEPPER; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; SOIL QUALITY; GROWERS; TOMATO; NETS	Growing colored bell peppers in high tunnels enhances fruit quality and accelerates ripening. While there are benefits to high tunnel pepper production, increased heat inside the structures can lead to plant stress, blossom drop, sunscald, and reduced marketable yields. The objective of this study was to test shadecloth treatments placed on high tunnels to mitigate heat stress and improve colored bell pepper yield and fruit quality, while also identifying cultivars that perform well within Midwest high tunnel systems. Research was conducted at the Iowa State University Horticulture Research Station (Ames, IA) from 11 May to 11 Oct. in 2017 and 3 May to 9 Oct. in 2018. Six single-poly passively ventilated Quonset high tunnels were used for the experiment. The shade treatments (no shadecloth, 30% light-reducing shadecloth, and 50% light-reducing shadecloth) were applied in June of each season. Within each shade treatment, there were three randomized complete blocks of the seven colored bell pepper cultivars (Archimedes, Delirio, Flavorburst, Red Knight, Sirius, Summer Sweet, and Tequila). Data were collected on yield, fruit quality, and plant growth characteristics. Environmental parameters were monitored throughout the growing season. Both the 30% and 50% shadecloth treatments reduced monthly average and maximum air temperatures within high tunnels, with the largest differences occurring in the months of July and August. The use of a shadecloth reduced the incidence of sunscald by 59% between no shade and 50% shadecloth treatments. While there was no difference between 30% and 50% shade treatments, the use of 50% shadecloth caused a decrease in both marketable number (32%) and weight (29%) of pepper fruit compared with the control. 'Tequila', 'Delirio', and 'Flavorburst' had more marketable fruit per plant. Shade treatments did not affect fruit soluble solids content (SSC), pH, or total titratable acidity (TTA). Shade treatments had no effect on Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) readings, shoot biomass, the number of leaves per plant or the total leaf area per plant; however, plant height increased by an average 14.5 cm for plants under shadecloth treatments. Average leaf size was 11.2 cm(2) larger on plants grown under the 50% shadecloth, compared with the control. Several cultivar differences existed for each fruit quality and plant growth parameter. While differences in fruit quality and plant growth parameters were limited among shade treatments, decreasing marketable yield is concerning. Our research suggests that Midwest growers should not exceed 30% light-reducing shadecloth on their high tunnels for colored bell pepper production.

J	A, LS; Hu, HY; Bai, XL				A, Lusi; Hu, Haiyang; Bai, Xianglan			Producing high yield of levoglucosan by pyrolyzing nonthermal plasma-pretreated cellulose	GREEN CHEMISTRY			English	Article							FREE-RADICALS; FAST PYROLYSIS; BIO-OIL; SOLUBILIZED CARBOHYDRATE; DEPOLYMERIZATION; MODEL; CRYSTALLINE; MECHANISMS; HYDROGEN; HYDRODEOXYGENATION	Atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma treatment can be a novel, green and low energy method to convert biomass to biobased chemicals. The unique physiochemistry of plasma discharge enables reactions within biomass that otherwise could not possibly occur under traditional conditions. In this study, we present a simple method of producing a high yield of levoglucosan from cellulose without using any catalysts, chemicals, solvents or vacuum, but by using plasma treatment to control the depolymerization mechanism of cellulose. Cellulose was first pretreated in a dielectric barrier discharge reactor operating in ambient air or argon for 10-60 s, followed by pyrolysis at 350-450 degrees C to produce up to 78.6% of levoglucosan. Without the plasma pretreatment, the maximum yield of levoglucosan from cellulose pyrolysis was 58.2%. The results of this study showed that the plasma pretreatment led to homolytic cleavage of glycosidic bonds. The resulting free radicals were then trapped within the cellulose structure when the plasma discharge stopped, allowing subsequent pyrolysis of the plasma-pretreated cellulose to proceed through a radical-based mechanism. The present results also revealed that although the radical-based mechanism is highly selective to levoglucosan formation, this pathway is usually discouraged when the untreated cellulose is pyrolyzed due to the high energy barrier for homolytic cleavage. Initiating homolytic cleavage during the plasma pretreatment also helped the pretreated cellulose to produce higher yields of levoglucosan using lower pyrolysis temperatures. At 375 degrees C, the levoglucosan yield was only 53.2% for the untreated cellulose, whereas the yield reached 77.6% for the argon-plasma pretreated cellulose.

Computational simulation of three-dimensional dynamic soil-pile group interaction in layered soils using disturbed-zone model	SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Soil-structure interaction; Dynamics; Pile group; Vibration; Boundary element analysis	VIBRATION; FOUNDATIONS; IMPEDANCES; BEHAVIOR; FIELD	Computational continuum models of piles embedded in disturbed zones are developed using the Boundary Element Method (BEM) for application to three-dimensional dynamic soil-pile group interaction in layered soils. The enhanced 3D BEM code BEASSI is validated for handling pile group problems by comparison with reference solutions. A general sub-structuring formulation is developed to calculate theoretical accelerance functions. A 3D disturbed-zone computational model is then extended to handle the dynamic response of a typical 2 x 2 pile group. The performance of the model is illustrated through convergence studies and a case study corresponding to full-scale field tests. The results indicate strong frequency-dependent pile-soil-pile interaction by impedance functions, group efficiency ratios, and pile deformations. The findings from this study provide new insights into dynamic soil-pile group interaction, and the general approach can be used to examine other pile and soil conditions.

Design Experimental crossover study. Animals Eight healthy adult Beagle dogs. Procedure All dogs received maropitant (1 mg kg(-1)) intravenously under the following conditions: 1) awake with non-invasive blood pressure monitoring (AwNIBP), 2) awake with invasive blood pressure monitoring (AwIBP), 3) premedication with acepromazine (0.005 mg kg(-1)) and butorphanol (0.2 mg kg(-1)) intramuscularly followed by propofol induction and isoflurane anesthesia (GaAB), and 4) premedication with dexmedetomidine (0.005 mg kg(-1)) and butorphanol (0.2 mg kg(-1)) intramuscularly followed by propofol induction and isoflurane anesthesia (GaDB). Heart rate (HR), systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP), and mean blood pressures (MAP) were recorded before injection of maropitant (baseline), during the first 60 seconds of injection, during the second 60 seconds of injection, at the completion of injection and every 2 minutes post injection for 18 minutes. The data were compared over time using a Generalized Linear Model with mixed effects and then with simple effect comparison with Bonferroni adjustments (p < 0.05). Results There were significant decreases from baseline in SAP in the GaAB group (p < 0.01) and in MAP and DAP in the AwIBP and GaAB (p < 0.001) groups during injection. A significant decrease in SAP (p < 0.05), DAP (p < 0.05), and MAP (p < 0.05) occurred at 16 minutes post injection in GaDB group. There was also a significant increase in HR in the AwIBP group (p < 0.01) during injection. Clinically significant hypotension occurred in the GaAB group with a mean MAP at 54 +/- 6 mmHg during injection. Conclusion Intravenous maropitant administration significantly decreases arterial blood pressure during inhalant anesthesia. Patients premedicated with acepromazine prior to isoflurane anesthesia may develop clinically significant hypotension.	[Chi, Ting-Ting; Kraus, Bonnie L.

Solid-Phase Microextraction Enables Isolation of BRAF V600E Circulating Tumor DNA from Human Plasma for Detection with a Molecular Beacon Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SORBENT COATINGS; EXTRACTION	Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising biomarker that can provide a wealth of information regarding the genetic makeup of cancer as well as provide a guide for monitoring treatment. Methods for rapid and accurate profiling of ctDNA are highly desirable in order to obtain the necessary information from this biomarker. However, isolation of ctDNA and its subsequent analysis remains a challenge due to the dependence on expensive and specialized equipment. In order to enable widespread implementation of ctDNA analysis, there is a need for low-cost and highly accurate methods that can be performed by nonexpert users. In this study, an assay is developed that exploits the high specificity of molecular beacon (MB) probes with the speed and simplicity of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the detection of the BRAF V600E single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Furthermore, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is applied for the successful isolation of clinically relevant concentrations (73.26 fM) of ctDNA from human plasma. In addition, the individual effects of plasma salts and protein on the extraction of ctDNA with SPME are explored. The performed work expands the use of MB-LAMP for SNP detection as well as demonstrates SPME as a sample preparation tool for nucleic acid analysis in plasma.

J	Zhang, M; Wang, C; O'Connor, A				Zhang, Min; Wang, Chong; O'Connor, Annette			A hierarchical Bayesian latent class mixture model with censorship for detection of linear temporal changes in antibiotic resistance	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; UNITED-STATES; SUSCEPTIBILITY; SURVEILLANCE	Identifying and controlling the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a high priority for researchers and public health officials. One critical component of this control effort is timely detection of emerging or increasing resistance using surveillance programs. Currently, detection of temporal changes in AMR relies mainly on analysis of the proportion of resistant isolates based on the dichotomization of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. In our work, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian latent class mixture model that incorporates a linear trend for the mean log(2)MIC of the non-resistant population. By introducing latent variables, our model addressed the challenges associated with the AMR MIC values, compensating for the censored nature of the MIC observations as well as the mixed components indicated by the censored MIC distributions. Inclusion of linear regression with time as a covariate in the hierarchical structure allowed modelling of the linear creep of the mean log(2)MIC in the non-resistant population. The hierarchical Bayesian model was accurate and robust as assessed in simulation studies. The proposed approach was illustrated using Salmonella enterica I,4,[5],12:i:- treated with chloramphenicol and ceftiofur in human and veterinary samples, revealing some significant linearly increasing patterns from the applications. Implementation of our approach to the analysis of an AMR MIC dataset would provide surveillance programs with a more complete picture of the changes in AMR over years by exploring the patterns of the mean resistance level in the non-resistant population. Our model could therefore serve as a timely indicator of a need for antibiotic intervention before an outbreak of resistance, highlighting the relevance of this work for public health. Currently, however, due to extreme right censoring on the MIC data, this approach has limited utility for tracking changes in the resistant population.

The proposed approach is used for fast uncertainty propagation in a reliability analysis of nondestructive testing systems using model-assisted probability of detection (MAPOD). In particular, PC-Cokriging is a multivariate version of polynomial chaos-based Kriging (PC-Kriging), which aims at combining the advantages of the regression-based polynomial chaos expansions and the interpolation-based Kriging metamodeling methods. Following a similar process as Cokriging, the PC-Cokriging advances PC-Kriging by enabling the incorporation of multifidelity physics information. The proposed PC-Cokriging is demonstrated on two analytical functions and three ultrasonic testing MAPOD cases. The results show that PC-Cokriging outperforms the state-of-the-art metamodeling approaches when providing the same number of training points. Specifically, PC-Cokriging reduces the high-fidelity training sample cost of the Kriging and PCE metamodels by over one order of magnitude, and the PC-Kriging and conventional Cokriging multifidelity metamodeling by up to 50% to reach the same accuracy level (defined by the root mean squared error being no greater than 1%of the standard deviation of the testing points). The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method of the key MAPOD metrics versus various detection thresholds are investigated and satisfactory results are obtained.

Influence of Largemouth Bass Behaviors, Angler Behaviors, and Environmental Conditions on Fishing Tournament Capture Success	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY			English	Article							HOME-RANGE SIZE; MICROPTERUS-SALMOIDES; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; SMALLMOUTH BASS; FISHERIES; CATCH; MORTALITY; TELEMETRY; SURVIVAL; HABITAT	Tournament anglers typically possess extensive knowledge of the habitat and seasonal movement of their targeted species. While fish-angler behavioral relationships are critical to understanding fish catchability, few studies have assessed how fish behavior influences their vulnerability to capture by tournament anglers. Our objectives were to determine if Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides behavior, angler behavior, and environmental conditions affect tournament angler catch rate (CPUE) and Largemouth Bass capture probability at fishing tournaments. Forty-nine Largemouth Bass were tracked weekly using radiotelemetry during a 4-month period. Five tournament anglers were also selected at weekly tournament events and tracked continuously using a handheld GPS unit. We quantified individual Largemouth Bass behaviors (home range, weekly movement rate, depth use, and spatial overlap with anglers), angler behaviors (depth use, angler movement rate), and environmental conditions (air and water temperature) and used these estimates as covariates in a multiple regression model to assess their effects on tournament CPUE and then used a multistate mark-recapture model to estimate Largemouth Bass capture probability at tournaments. Our results indicate that Largemouth Bass movement rate, angler fishing depth, and air temperature were highly correlated to tournament angler CPUE. Mark-recapture models also indicated that air temperature and angler-fish overlap were positively associated with Largemouth Bass capture probability while fish total length, home range, movement rate, and depth use were not successful in characterizing individual variation in capture probability. Our results indicate that Largemouth Bass that are encountered by anglers are more likely to be captured, whereas mismatches between angler and Largemouth Bass behavioral factors, including depth use and movement rates, may result in decreased tournament capture rates. Consideration and continued evaluation of the relationships between Largemouth Bass and angler behaviors and environmental variables is critical to fisheries management as tournament pressure paired with high capture probabilities and selective angling can have large-scale population-level impacts.

C	Hu, H		Hoarau, Y; Peng, SH; Schwamborn, D; Revell, A; Mockett, C		Hu, Hui			Development of Advanced Flow Diagnostic Techniques to Characterize Aircraft Icing Phenomena	PROGRESS IN HYBRID RANS-LES MODELLING	Notes on Numerical Fluid Mechanics and Multidisciplinary Design		English	Proceedings Paper	7th Symposium on Hybrid RANS-LES Methods	SEP 17-19, 2018	CFD Software E + F GmbH, Berlin, GERMANY	Univ Strasbourg, AIRBUS, ANSYS, Rolls Royce, Tecplot	CFD Software E + F GmbH			Aircraft icing phenomena involve in complicated interactions among multiphase flows (i.e., gaseous airflow, super-cooled liquid water droplets/surface water film flows, and ice accreting solid surface) coupled with unsteady heat transfer (i.e., the release of the latent heat of fusion) and dynamic phase changing (i.e., solidification) processes. In the present study, the research progress made in our recent efforts to develop advanced flow diagnostic techniques to characterize the complex multiphase flows pertinent to aircraft icing phenomena is presented. A novel lifetime-based molecular tagging thermometry (MTT) is introduced to achieve simultaneous measurements of droplet size (in terms of volume, height, contact area and the contact angle of the droplet) and temporally-and-spatially-resolved temperature distributions within micro-sized, icing water droplets to quantify the unsteady heat transfer and phase changing process pertinent to the ice formation and accretion processes as water droplets impinge onto frozen cold aircraft wings. A novel structure-light-based digital image projection (DIP) technique is also introduced to achieve quantitative measurements of the droplet/film thickness distributions to quantify the dynamic surface water runback process pertinent to glaze ice accretion process over an airfoil/wing surface. The quantitative measurements are very helpful to elucidate the underlying physics pertinent aircraft icing phenomena as well as to develop more effective and robust anti-/de-icing strategies for aircraft icing mitigation.

Biodegradable polyanhydrides have been investigated extensively to overcome such challenges. It has been shown that controlling copolymer composition can result in chemistry-dependent immunomodulatory capabilities. These studies have revealed that copolymers rich in sebacic acid (SA) are highly internalized by antigen presenting cells and confer improved shelf stability of encapsulated proteins, while copolymers rich in 1,8-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)-3,6-dioxaoctane (CPTEG) also exhibit enhanced internalization by and activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), in addition to providing superior retention of protein stability following encapsulation and release. However, to date, CPTEG:SA copolymers have not been synthesized and described. In this work, we hypothesized that new copolymers composed of CPTEG and SA would combine the advantages of both monomers in terms of enhanced thermal properties, maintaining antigenicity of encapsulated proteins following nanoparticle synthesis, and superior cellular internalization and activation by APCs, demonstrated by the upregulation of costimulatory markers CD80, CD86, and CD40, as well as the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha. Herein, we describe the synthesis and design of novel CPTEG:SA nanoparticles with improved thermal properties, payload stability, and internalization by antigen presenting cells for applications in vaccine delivery. The performance of these new CPTEG:SA formulations was compared to that of traditional polyanhydride copolymers.

Drawing from critical disciplinary literacy (CDL) theory, this article presents findings from a mini-unit co-designed and co-taught by an Iowa state district court judge and literacy professor that sought to teach 24 U.S. History students the disciplinary particulars of applying critical literacies while reading legal opinions issued by an all-male state Supreme Court. Analysis of student responses reveals that the CDL mini-unit helped most students experience disciplinary belonging and develop text-dependent skills; additionally, most students began to consider writers' positionalities when sourcing legal opinions. Yet, a small group of students repudiated the CDL mini-unit, evidenced through both resignation and overt resistance to discussing systems of power and oppression. Implications for secondary students and teachers are discussed.

J	Curtzwiler, GW; Silva, P; Hall, A; Ivey, A; Vorst, K				Curtzwiler, Greg W.; Silva, Paulo; Hall, Alexander; Ivey, Alexandra; Vorst, Keith			Significance of Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Food Packaging	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Perfluoroalkyl substances; PFAS; Food packaging; NIAS; Nonintentionally added substance	ACIDS	Food safety authorities and the food industry are focused on uses of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in various food-contact packaging applications. Not widely known until recently, certain PFAS occur in paper-based packaging materials typically at parts-per-billion to parts-per-million concentrations. These substances are nonintentionally added substances (NIAS) and are attributed to residues from recycled fiber and paperboard used in the manufacture of new food packaging products. Low concentration PFAS detection has generated debate in the food industry and among scientific and governmental organizations about understanding their significance in food-contact products because certain PFAS are intentionally added to some food packaging materials. Distinguishing between both sources of PFAS in food packaging is essential for regulatory compliance purposes. In this paper, we describe ongoing research using contact angle measurement analysis to determine limits of performance (LOP) for perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) (C4, C6, C8, and C10) on the surface of recycled paper packaging materials. We find that the LOP concentrations for PFCAs ranged from 37 ppm (C10) to higher than 1238 ppm (C4). Because there is no economic justification for the presence of PFAS that do not provide functional performance, these LOP concentrations can reliably be considered as NIAS thresholds. This analytical method and the resulting test data are able to differentiate the source of PFAS in food packaging. Future research will broaden the test method to include measurements of fluorotelomer, sulfonamide, and fluoropolymer substances to develop a more comprehensive understanding of PFAS performance and NIAS concentration thresholds.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;00:1-6.

Adverse effects on growth performance and bone development in nursery pigs fed diets marginally deficient in phosphorus with increasing calcium to available phosphorus ratios	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						bone mineral content; dual x-ray absorptiometry; swine	DIGESTIBLE CALCIUM; ASH CONCENTRATION; IMMUNE-SYSTEM; PHYTASE; REQUIREMENT; ADAPTATION; SERUM	The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the growth performance and bone mineral content (BMC) of nursery pigs in response to increasing total calcium (Ca) to available phosphorus (aP) ratios in diets containing phytase (250 FTU/kg; Natuphos E, BASF, Florham Park, NJ). A total of 480 nursery pigs (body weight (BW) = 5.7 +/- 0.6 kg) with 10 pigs per pen and 7 pens per treatment (6 pens fed 2.75:1 diet) were allotted to seven treatments consisting of increasing ratios of calcium to available phosphorus (Ca:aP): 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.25, 2.50, and 2.75. From day -7 to 0, pigs were fed a common diet. They were then fed the treatment diets during two experimental phases from day 1 to 14 and 15 to 28, respectively. Available P was formulated to 0.33% and 0.27% (approximately 90% of requirement) in dietary phases 1 and 2, respectively. BW, average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) were determined. BMC of the femur was measured on day 28 on one pig per pen using dual x-ray absorptiometry. Data were analyzed as a linear mixed model using PROC MIXED (SAS, 9.3). Orthogonal polynomial contrasts were used to determine the linear and quadratic effects of increasing the Ca:aP. Over the 28-d experimental period, increasing Ca:aP resulted in a linear decrease in ADG (353, 338, 328, 304, 317, 291, and 280 g/d; P < 0.01), ADFI (539, 528, 528, 500, 533, 512, and 489 g/d; P < 0.05), and G:F (0.68, 0.66, 0.64, 0.62, 0.61, 0.59, and 0.58; P < 0.01). Increasing Ca:aP also resulted in decreased BW on days 14 and 28 (P < 0.01). The BMC of the femur decreased with increasing Ca:aP (6.2, 6.3, 5.7, 5.9, 5.5, 5.6, and 5.3 g; P < 0.05). Regression analysis explained the impact of Ca:aP as follows on ADG (ADG [g/d] = 339 - 36x; r(2) = 0.81), G:F (G:F = 0.61 - 0.03x; r(2) = 0.72), and BMC (BMC [g] = 6.4 - 0.27x; r(2) = 0.43), where x is the Ca:aP. In conclusion, all outcomes indicated that any level of calcium above the minimum used in this experiment impaired growth performance and skeletal development. Further research using even lower levels of dietary Ca is warranted.

IDENTIFICATION AND CORRELATION OF A NOVEL SIADENOVIRUS IN A FLOCK OF BUDGERIGARS (MELOPSITTACUS UNDULATES) INFECTED WITH SALMONELLA TYPHIMURIUM IN THE UNITED STATES	JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE; GENOME ORGANIZATION; TAXONOMIC PROPOSALS; RATIFICATION VOTE; AVIAN ADENOVIRUS; PSITTACINE BIRDS; DNA-SEQUENCE; DIFFERENTIATION; COLLECTION; EVENTS	A flock of budgerigars (Melopsitiacus undulates) was purchased from a licensed breeder and quarantined at a zoologic facility within the United States in 2016. Following 82 deaths within the flock, the remaining 66 birds were depopulated because of ongoing clinical salmonellosis despite treatment. Gross necropsy was performed on all 66 birds. Histopathologic examination was performed on 10 birds identified with gross lesions and 10 birds without. Pathologic findings were most often observed in the liver, kidney, and spleen. Lesions noted in the livers and spleens were consistent with published reports of salmonellosis in psittacine species. Multisystemic changes associated with septicemia were not noted, most likely because of antibiotic intervention before euthanasia. Of the 20 budgerigars evaluated by histopathology, six had large basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies within tubular epithelia in a portion of the kidneys. Electronic microscopy, next-generation sequencing, Sanger sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses were used to identify and categorize the identified virus as a novel siadenovirus strain BuAdV-1 USA-IA43444-2016. The strain was 99% similar to budgerigar adenovirus 1 (BuAdV-1), previously reported in Japan, and to a psittacine adenovirus 5 recently identified in a U.S. cockatiel. Salmonella typhimurium carriers were identified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bacterial culture and compared with viral carriers identified via PCR. Inclusion bodies and Salmonella detection were significant in birds with gross lesions versus those without; however, there was no correlation between budgerigars positive with siadenovirus by PCR and concurrent Salmonella infection. Identifying subclinical siadenovirus strain BuAdV-1 USA-IA43444-2016 infection in this flock significantly differs from a previous report of clinical illness in five budgerigars resulting in death caused by BuAdV-1 in Japan. S. typhimurium remains a significant pathogen in budgerigars, and zoonotic concerns prompted depopulation to mitigate the public health risks of this flock.

Alternative handling tools for moving grow-finish pig cadavers	JOURNAL OF SWINE HEALTH AND PRODUCTION			English	Article						swine; caretakers; grow-finish pig; handling tools; non-ambulatory pigs		The National Pork Board provides recommendations for humane handling tools and non-ambulatory pig handling methods. However, there are limited published studies that evaluate the efficacy of handling tools for on-farm manual movement of grow-finish non-ambulatory or cadaver pigs. A sked, deer sled, and modified deer sled were studied as handling tools for non-ambulatory grow-finish pigs. Handling tools were tested on-farm using pig cadavers (59-134 kg) to evaluate effectiveness based on employee effort and opinion. Our results support the sked and deer sled as effective handling tools to move grow-finish pigs, while the modified deer sled was ineffective.

J	Zheng, XF; Liu, CM; Wei, P				Zheng, Xufang; Liu, Chia-Mei; Wei, Peng			Air Transportation Direct Share Analysis and Forecast	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							RANDOM FOREST; CHOICE BEHAVIOR; MODEL; REGRESSION; AIRPORT	Air transportation direct share is the ratio of direct passengers to total passengers on a directional origin and destination (O&D) pair. Direct share is an essential factor of passenger flow distribution and shows passengers' general preference for direct flight services on a certain O&D. A better understanding and a more accurate forecast of direct share can benefit air transportation planners, airlines, and airports in multiple ways. In most of the previous research and applications, it is commonly assumed that direct share is a fixed ratio, which contradicts the air transportation practice. In the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Terminal Area Forecast (TAF), the O&D direct share is forecasted as a constant based on the latest observation of direct share on the O&D. To find factors which have significant impacts on O&D direct share and to build an accurate model for O&D direct share forecasting, both parametric and nonparametric machine learning models are investigated in this research. We propose a novel category-based learning method which can provide better forecasting performance compared to employing the single modeling method for O&D direct share forecasting. Based on the comparison, the developed category-based learning model is a promising replacement for the model used for O&D direct share forecasting by the FAA TAF.

Skills are practiced in increasing stress conditions that approximate the operational environment. Practice continues until stress resilience and task proficiency are achieved. The use of virtual reality (VR) for inducing a stress response has increased in popularity in recent years. The ability to simulate operational tasks could create training based on graduated stress exposure. However, more research is needed to verify that stress levels can be effectively manipulated in the virtual environment during training, and that the VR training task accurately replicates the existing task procedure. The objective of this study was to investigate the creation of different VR stressor levels from existing emergency spaceflight procedures and validate three distinguishable stressor levels (i.e., low, medium, high). Experts in spaceflight procedures and the human stress response helped design a VR spaceflight environment and emergency fire task procedure. A within-subject experiment was conducted using the three stressor levels. Sixty-one healthy participants completed three trials in VR to locate and extinguish a fire on the International Space Station (VR-ISS). Self-assessment was implemented for each stressor level; NASA Task load index, Post Task Stress Reaction scale, Free stress scale, Positive and Negative Affect Scale, and Short Stress State Questionnaire were used for assessment. The results suggest that the stressors can induce different, distinguishable, levels of stress in trainees for use in graduated stress exposure training.

In the present study, the effects of ferrohydrodynamics (FHD) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) are taken into account simultaneously. It is assumed that the non-Newtonian fluid obeys the power-law model. Furthermore, the inner cylinder is considered to be rotating in order to create the forced convection effects. The effect of various parameters, namely, the Richardson number (0.1-10), power-law index (0.8-1.2), magnetic number arising due to the FHD principles (0-5), and the Hartmann number as a result of MHD effects (0-5) on the mixed convection performance have been examined. The results reveal that an increase of the Richardson number causes an increase in the average Nusselt number for the pseudoplastic and Newtonian fluids, while this trend is nearly negligible for a dilatant fluid. In addition, regardless of the value of all considered parameters, it is observed that the average Nusselt number is a decreasing function of the power-law index. Considering the FHD effects, it is noticed that for pseudoplastic fluid the Nusselt number increases as the magnetic number is enhanced but the opposite manner occurs for a dilatant fluid. Also, application of magnetic field causes both enhancement and deterioration effects on the heat transfer of Newtonian ferrofluids depending on the Richardson number. Under MHD conditions, an increasing Hartmann number results in a decreasing Nusselt number for a pseudoplastic fluid, whereas this effect is not considerable for Newtonian and dilatant ferrofluids.

Tetrahydrofuran-based two-step solvent liquefaction process for production of lignocellulosic sugars	REACTION CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article							ENZYMATIC-HYDROLYSIS; FAST PYROLYSIS; IONIC-LIQUID; SOLUBILIZED CARBOHYDRATE; CHEMICAL CONVERSION; GAMMA-VALEROLACTONE; LIGNIN REMOVAL; ACID; PRETREATMENT; CELLULOSE	Large-scale production of biofuels and chemicals will require cost-effective, sustainable, and rapid deconstruction of woody biomass into its constituent sugars. Here, we introduce a novel two-step liquefaction process for producing fermentable sugars from red oak using a mixture of tetrahydrofuran (THF), water and dilute sulfuric acid. THF promotes acid-catalyzed solubilization of lignin and hemicellulose in biomass achieving 61% lignin extraction and 64% xylose recovery in a mild pretreatment step. The pretreatment opens the structure of biomass through delignification and produces a cellulose-rich biomass, which is readily solubilized at low temperature giving 65% total sugar yields in a subsequent liquefaction process employing the same solvent mixture. This process achieves competitive sugar yields at high volumetric productivity compared to conventional saccharification methods. THF, which can be derived from renewable resources, has several benefits as solvent including ease of recovery from the sugar solution and relatively low toxicity and cost.

The effect of moisture on hydrocarbon-based solvent liquefaction of pine, cellulose and lignin	JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS			English	Article						Liquefaction; Pine; Cellulose; Lignin; Tetralin; Water	HYDROTHERMAL CARBONIZATION; LIGNOCELLULOSIC BIOMASS; SUPERCRITICAL WATER; CHEMICAL RECOVERY; PROCESS PARAMETER; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; KRAFT LIGNIN; CONVERSION; PYROLYSIS; TETRALIN	In this paper we examined the effect of moisture on the solvent liquefaction of loblolly pine, cellulose, and lignin in tetralin at 280 degrees C and pressures ranging from 15 to 70 bar. Solvent liquefaction experiments were conducted in a quasi-batch reactor capable of continuous pressure control and external vapor condensation. Moisture was varied by the controlled addition of de-ionized water. Control over the system pressure subsequently impacted the removal of water vapor from the reactor. Liquid yield decreased by 25, 21, and 35 wt%, for pine, cellulose, and lignin, respectively, when moisture content was increased from 1 to 50 wt% at 42 bar. Humins were observed in the solid residue from liquefaction of wet cellulose. Wet lignin yielded a substantial amount of solid residue compared to dry lignin with a corresponding decrease in total phenolic monomer production. It was concluded that the ionic dissociation of water was an important factor in loss of liquid yield in the presence of water. Although water was less than 20 wt% of the solvent loading in these experiments, it strongly influenced the liquefaction of biomass and biomass components.

In the Surveillance Team Tutor (STT), learners performed a surveillance task in a virtual environment, communicating to track hostile moving soldiers. This collaborative problem solving task required significant communication to achieve the common goal of perfect surveillance. In a pilot evaluation, 16 two-person teams performed the task within one of three feedback conditions (Individual, Team, or None) across four trials each. The STT used a unique approach to filtering feedback so that teams in both individual and team conditions received a similar amount of feedback. In one performance measure, Team condition participants made fewer errors in one task than those in other conditions, though at a potential cost of mental workload. Feedback condition also significantly affected participants' subjective rating of both their own performance and their teammate's. This ITTS is one of the first automated team tutoring systems that provided real-time feedback during task execution. Recommendations are offered for the design of the optimal team task for future ITTSs that offer tutoring for small teams performing collaborative problem solving.

The conventional diagnostic methods such as neuroimaging for these diseases are not only expensive but also time-consuming, resulting in significant financial burdens for patients and public health challenge for nations around the world. Hence early detection of neuro-DDs in a cost-effective and rapid manner is critically needed. For the past decades, some chip-based detection technologies have been developed to address this challenge, showing great potential in achieving point-of-care (POC) diagnostics of neuro-DDs. In this review, chip-based detection of neuro-DDs' biomarkers enabled by different transducing mechanisms is evaluated.

The I/O CRN receives its input as a continuous time signal consisting of concentrations of chemical species that vary to represent the NFA's input string in a natural way. The I/O CRN exploits the inherent parallelism of chemical kinetics to simulate the NFA in real time with a number of chemical species that is linear in the size of the NFA. We prove that the simulation is correct and that it is robust with respect to perturbations of the input signal, the initial concentrations of species, the output (decision), and the rate constants of the reactions of the I/O CRN.

Perceived losses of scientific integrity under the Trump administration: A survey of federal scientists	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SCIENCE; TRANSPARENCY; BENEFITS; IMPACT; ROLES; AIR; AGE	President Trump and his administration have been regarded by news outlets and scholars as one of the most hostile administrations towards scientists and their work. However, no study to-date has empirically measured how federal scientists perceive the Trump administration with respect to their scientific work. In 2018, we distributed a survey to over 63,000 federal scientists from 16 federal agencies to assess their perception of scientific integrity. Here we discuss the results of this survey for a subset of these agencies: Department of Interior (DOI) agencies (the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the US Geological Survey, and the National Park Service); the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We focus our analysis to 10 key questions fitting within three core categories that relate to perceptions of integrity in science. Additionally, we analyzed responses across agencies and compare responses in the 2018 survey to prior year surveys of federal scientists with similar survey questions. Our results indicate that federal scientists perceive losses of scientific integrity under the Trump Administration. Perceived loss of integrity in science was greater at the DOI and EPA where federal scientists ranked incompetent and untrustworthy leadership as top barriers to science-based decision-making, but this was not the case at the CDC, FDA, and NOAA where scientists positively associated leadership with scientific integrity. We also find that reports of political interference in scientific work and adverse work environments were higher at EPA and FWS in 2018 than in prior years.

Menu development for meetings and events: an opportunity for conveying cultural diversity and inclusion initiatives	JOURNAL OF CONVENTION & EVENT TOURISM			English	Article						Cultural exchange; diversity; event planning; inclusion; menu	FOOD	Meetings and events present opportunities to bring together diverse groups of people. Reflective of the greater diversity and inclusion movements in the country, event planners are tasked with creating agendas that support these initiatives. Creating these agendas often involves menu planning and development for meals and snacks served during the event. Culture is a social construct that can be described as the behaviors, values and beliefs that a group of people shares. Race, ethnicity, religion, socio-economic status, and geographical location all contribute to culture and cultural diversity. Conversely, a lack of culturally appropriate options for attendees, including food options, may lead to feelings of unwelcomeness or outright exclusion. This paper discusses food as a reflection of culture and therefore, a mechanism for conveying an agenda supporting diversity and inclusivity. A review of literature was conducted to determine strategies for constructing menus and food schedules that support this agenda and presents an opportunity for cultural exchange in which food experiences, traditions, and knowledge are shared among attendees with various backgrounds. Leveraging this opportunity for cultural exchange using food as the vehicle requires knowledge of the expected demographics of attendees, culturally competent foodservice professionals, and purposeful integration of food into event programming.

To analyze its dynamic characteristics with both mathematical and engineering rigors, a detailed mathematical model is needed. Although composite load model of WECC is available in commercial software as a module and its detailed block diagrams can be found in several public reports, there is no complete mathematical representation of the full model in literature. This paper addresses a challenging problem of deriving detailed mathematical representation of composite load model of WECC from its block diagrams. In particular, we have derived the mathematical representation of the new DER_A model. The developed mathematical model is verified using both MATLAB and PSS/E to show its effectiveness in representing composite load model of WECC. The derived mathematical representation serves as an important foundation for parameter identification, order reduction and other dynamic analysis.

EFFECT OF BLENDING AMARANTH GRAIN WITH MAIZE KERNELS ON MAIZE WEEVIL CONTROL DURING STORAGE	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Broken corn and foreign material; Insects; Insect infestation; Mechanical damage; Moisture content; Postharvest losses; Relative humidity; Temperature; Test weight		Amaranth (Amaranthus spp.) is used as a vegetable, food, forage, and sometimes an ornamental. Amaranth grain has higher protein content than other cereals, making it a good choice for human consumption. Maize is among the three most widely grown grains in the world, but it can experience large postharvest losses during storage due to infestation by the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais). Due to the small size of amaranth seeds, this study postulated that amaranth grain can be blended with maize during storage to fill the intergranular spaces between maize kernels, reducing the overall void volume to minimize maize weevil movements to access the kernels, and thereby controlling the maize weevil population. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects on maize weevil control of blending maize with amaranth grain during storage versus storing maize alone. Three 208 L (55 gal) steel barrels were loaded with 160 kg (353 lb) of maize, and three were loaded with a maize-amaranth mixture (1:1 by volume), all with initial weevil populations of 25 live weevils per kg of maize. Blending maize with amaranth for storage reduced the number of live weevils after 160 days by 66% compared to storing maize alone. Additional reduction of live weevils could be accomplished if the maize were completely covered by amaranth grain, further restricting maize weevil access to the maize kernels.

J	Van Velson, N; Zobeiri, H; Wang, XW				Van Velson, Nathan; Zobeiri, Hamidreza; Wang, Xinwei			Rigorous prediction of Raman intensity from multi-layer films	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article								In the Raman probing of multilayer thin film materials, the intensity of the measured Raman scattered light will be impacted by the thickness of the thin film layers. The Raman signal intensity will vary non-monotonically with thickness due to interference from the multiple reflections of both the incident laser light and the Raman scattered light of thin film interfaces. Here, a method for calculating the Raman signal intensity from a multilayer thin film system based on the transfer matrix method with a rigorous treatment of the Raman signal generation (discontinuity) is presented. This calculation methodology is valid for any thin film stack with an arbitrary number of layers with arbitrary thicknesses. This approach is applied to several thin film material systems, including silicon-on-sapphire thin films, graphene on Si with a SiO2 capping layer, and multilayer MoS2 with the presence of a gap between layers and substrate. Different applications where this method can be used in the Raman probing of thin film material properties are discussed.

Evaluation of a multipump air pistol as a method for euthanizing young dairy goat kids	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH			English	Article							NONPENETRATING CAPTIVE BOLT; MENINGOENCEPHALITIS; EFFICACY	OBJECTIVE To assess the extent of damage to the skull and brain of cadaveric dairy goat kids caused by a .22-caliber, 16-g pellet fired from a multipump air pistol at various power levels. SAMPLE Cadavers of 8 male and 7 female dairy goat kids <= 5 days old. PROCEDURES Each cadaver was positioned in sternal recumbency with the head and neck extended on a straw bale. A multipump air pistol was held with the barrel perpendicular to and 2.5 cm from the head at the intersection of 2 imaginary lines that extended from the lateral canthus of each eye to the middle of the contralateral ear base and fired at half (5 pumps; n = 2), intermediate (7 pumps; 2), or full (10 pumps; 11) power. The head and neck were removed from the carcass for CT imaging and gross sectioning to determine the location of the pellet and extent of damage caused to the skull and brain. RESULTS The pellet successfully penetrated the skull of all 13 heads shot at full or intermediate power and 1 of the 2 heads shot at half power. The pellet did not fragment after entering the skull of any cadaver and penetrated the brainstem (necessary for instantaneous death) in only 7 cadavers. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The described technique was insufficient for use as a stand-alone method for euthanizing young dairy goat kids. Modification of the technique warrants further research to determine whether air pistols can be used to effectively euthanize young goat kids.

They serve many important biotic roles, including interference with herbivore movement. Characterizing the number, density, and distribution of trichomes can provide valuable insights on plant response to insect infestation and define the extent of plant defense capability. Automated trichome counting would speed up this research but poses several challenges, primarily because of the variability in coloration and the high occlusion of the trichomes. Methods and Results We developed a simplified method for image processing for automated and semi-automated trichome counting. We illustrate this process using 30 leaves from 10 genotypes of soybean (Glycine max) differing in trichome abundance. We explored various heuristic image-processing methods including thresholding and graph-based algorithms to facilitate trichome counting. Of the two automated and two semi-automated methods for trichome counting tested and with the help of regression analysis, the semi-automated manually annotated trichome intersection curve method performed best, with an accuracy of close to 90% compared with the manually counted data. Conclusions We address trichome counting challenges including occlusion by combining image processing with human intervention to propose a semi-automated method for trichome quantification. This provides new opportunities for the rapid and automated identification and quantification of trichomes, which has applications in a wide variety of disciplines.

Additional 7-and 28-day compressive strength tests, as well as 1-, 7-, and 28-day splitting tensile strength tests, were carried out on the mixtures without and with 0.3% carbon microfiber. Results showed that, overall, increasing the carbon microfiber dosage increased the compressive strength, particularly at early ages. Splitting tensile strength results were used along with the restrained shrinkage ring results to quantify the restrained shrinkage cracking potential of the mixtures. It was found that carbon microfiber and SRA can both significantly reduce the drying shrinkage cracking potential of concrete. The combination of SRA and ACC in concrete provided compatible effects, characterized by increased early-age compressive strength, as well as reduced shrinkage and cracking potential.

With the recent emergence of novel virulent strains, these viruses can have a large impact on human and animal health. Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is considered to be a reemerging pig disease caused by the enteropathogenic alphacoronavirus PED virus (PEDV). In the absence of effective vaccines, infection prevention and control through diagnostic testing and quarantine are critical. Early detection and differential diagnosis of PEDV infections increase the chance of successful control of the disease. Therefore, there is a continuous need for development of reduced assay-step protocols, no-wash, high-throughput immunoassays. This study described the characterization of the humoral immune response against PEDV under experimental and field conditions using a rapid, sensitive, luminescent proximity homogenous assay (AlphaLISA). PEDV IgG and IgA antibodies were developed toward the beginning of the second week of infection. PEDV IgG antibodies were detected for at least 16 weeks post-exposure. Remarkably, the serum IgA levels remained high and relatively stable throughout the study, lasting longer than the serum IgG response. Overall, AlphaLISA allows the detection and characterization of pathogen-specific antibodies with new speed, sensitivity, and simplicity of use. Particularly, the bridge assay constitutes a rapid diagnostic that substantially improves upon the "time to result" metric of currently available immunoassays.

Polystyrene fillers are dispersed with styrene/dimethylsiloxane symmetric diblock and triblock copolymers that control the filler morphology, filler-matrix interactions, and filler-filler interactions. Surprisingly, the composites not only rival the traditional silica-reinforced polysiloxane in mechanical properties of cured materials but also have better processability and stability than the silica-filled compound before curing. Large amplitude oscillatory shear experiments demonstrate that the triblock copolymer addition strongly affects the rheological properties. We hypothesize that the bridges and entangled loops that were formed by the triblock copolymer can connect different PS domains to provide additional reinforcement. The aging effect that originates from PDMS chain adsorption on the filler particle surface is also avoided because of the thermodynamic repulsion between PS and PDMS phases.

Prediction of mitochondrial genome-wide variation through sequencing of mitochondrion-enriched extracts	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EUROPEAN CORN-BORER; FRAMESHIFT MUTATIONS; OSTRINIA-FURNACALIS; READ ALIGNMENT; DNA; POPULATION; EVOLUTION; MODEL; GENE; RECOMBINATION	Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype variation is often applied for estimating population dynamics and phylogenetic relationships, economical and generalized methods for entire mtDNA genome enrichment prior to high-throughput sequencing are not readily available. This study demonstrates the utility of differential centrifugation to enrich for mitochondrion within cell extracts prior to DNA extraction, short-read sequencing, and assembly using exemplars from eight maternal lineages of the insect species, Ostrinia nubilalis. Compared to controls, enriched extracts showed a significant mean increase of 48.2- and 86.1-fold in mtDNA based on quantitative PCR, and proportion of subsequent short sequence reads that aligned to the O. nubilalis reference mitochondrial genome, respectively. Compared to the reference genome, our de novo assembled O. nubilalis mitochondrial genomes contained 82 intraspecific substitution and insertion/deletion mutations, and provided evidence for correction of mis-annotated 28 C-terminal residues within the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4. Comparison to a more recent O. nubilalis mtDNA assembly from unenriched short-read data analogously showed 77 variant sites. Twenty-eight variant positions, and a triplet ATT codon (Ile) insertion within ATP synthase subunit 8, were unique within our assemblies. This study provides a generalizable pipeline for whole mitochondrial genome sequence acquisition adaptable to applications across a range of taxa.

Manual and ground penetrating radar field measurements of field-corn spacing, planting depth, and furrow feature identification	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						A & B-scans; Ground penetrating radar; Hyperbolic features; Radargrams; Planting depth	ROOT BIOMASS; SEED	The objective of this study was to investigate the utility of a 2.6 GHz GPR system to measure seed spacing and planting depth in a closed furrow and identify features that could potentially represent the furrow path. The experimental design had four treatments: two downforce pressures, three populations and planting depth, and two plots. The downforces significantly affected the planting depths and variability. The planting depth variability was more than the nominal resolution of the planter. The planter failed to satisfy the percent coefficient of precision and coefficient of planting depth accuracy parameters. Hyperbolic features were observed in the radargrams, but there were random across the radargram. The hyperbolic features were inconsistent with the seed depth and it was challenging to identify individual corn seed. There were horizontal features that were consistent and had similar two-way travel times to the bands observed in parallel and perpendicular radargrams. If the two-way travel times were the same, then it is highly likely that the bands in the parallel and perpendicular radargrams are from the same feature. Using the perpendicular to matchup with the parallel A-scans features that could represent the furrow were effectively identified. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Mapoka, Kenneth O.

An Ethnographic Case Study of Affordances in an Architecture Design Studio	TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD			English	Article							EDUCATIONAL AFFORDANCES; FEEDBACK INTERVENTIONS; PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY; SIGNATURE PEDAGOGIES; SCIENCE; FRAMEWORK; TECHNOLOGY; ARTS	Background/Context: Studio-based courses-the primary approach in design education-have been viewed as effective environments for learning. This study uses an ecological approach to explore how the studio environment creates opportunities for social interaction through immersive studies of studio learning. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: We engaged in an ethnographic case study of a beginning architecture design course aimed at exploring the ways the learning environment of the studio affords social interaction, and how these interactions shape students' understandings and behaviors as they learn. Particular attention was paid to the physical, structural, and instructional affordances that contribute to learning in the studio environment. Setting: Over the course of one semester, we observed nine students and their instructor in Architecture Design 1 (AD 1), a first-year architecture studio at a large, public research institution. Population/Participants/Subjects: The student participants ranged in age from 18 to 25, four of the participants identified as students of color, two identified as international students, three identified as female, and six, male. The instructor, who identifies as female, had taught AD 1 at the university for eight years prior to the study and holds a master's degree in architecture. Research Design: We engaged in an ethnographic case study using an ecological approach, focused on the relationship between humans and their environment. We view learning and knowledge as individually constructed by the learner in a socially situated, public context; as such, a case study design using ethnographic methods of data collection was employed. Data Collection and Analysis: Our data sources included observations of daily studio activities, participant interviews, researcher reflections on studio visits, and course artifacts such as the course syllabus and assignment handouts. We analyzed data using a two-cycle method of coding and analysis focusing on identifying patterns or themes in the data. Findings/Results: We found several physical, structural, and instructional affordances that contribute to learning. The physical affordances of the studio environment of AD 1 included the open layout, public/private workspaces, and co-working in proximity to others. The structural affordances were long blocks of unscheduled work time, the project brief, and the sequencing of the projects, tasks, and deadlines. The instructional affordances included formal and informal critique, "mini-lectures," and demonstrations. Conclusions/Recommendations: Although focused within a design discipline, our findings have broader applicability to collegiate academic environments that support student learning. Recommendations include creating fluidity in the classroom space, centralizing feedback, demonstrating emerging understandings visually, and constraining constructivist learning environments.

Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a lesser-researched coronavirus, can infect naive pigs of any age, but clinical disease is observed in pigs <= 4 weeks of age. No commercial PHEV vaccines are available, and neonatal protection from PHEV-associated disease is presumably dependent on lactogenic immunity. Although subclinical PHEV infections are thought to be common, PHEV ecology in commercial swine herds is unknown. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, a serum IgG antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the S1 protein was developed and evaluated on known-status samples and then used to estimate PHEV seroprevalence in U.S. sow herds. Assessment of the diagnostic performance of the PHEV S1 ELISA using serum samples (n = 924) collected from 7-week-old pigs (n = 84; 12 pigs per group) inoculated with PHEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, or porcine deltacoronavirus showed that a sample-to-positive cutoff value of >= 0.6 was both sensitive and specific, i.e., all PHEV-inoculated pigs were seropositive from days postinoculation 10 to 42, and no cross-reactivity was observed in samples from other groups. The PHEV S1 ELISA was then used to estimate PHEV seroprevalence in U.S. sow herds (19 states) using 2,756 serum samples from breeding females (>28 weeks old) on commercial farms (n = 104) with no history of PHEV-associated disease. The overall seroprevalence was 53.35% (confidence interval [CI], +/- 1.86%) and herd seroprevalence was 96.15% (CI, +/- 3.70%). IMPORTANCE There is a paucity of information concerning the ecology of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in commercial swine herds. This study provided evidence that PHEV infection is endemic and highly prevalent in U.S. swine herds. These results raised questions for future studies regarding the impact of endemic PHEV on swine health and the mechanisms by which this virus circulates in endemically infected populations. Regardless, the availability of the validated PHEV 51 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) provides the means for swine producers to detect and monitor PHEV infections, confirm prior exposure to the virus, and to evaluate the immune status of breeding herds.

Methods for reproductive tract scoring as a tool for improving sow productivity	TRANSLATIONAL ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						gilt; litter size; sow lifetime productivity; vulva width	PREGNANCY; GILT; PIG; MEISHAN; ESTRUS; AGE	Improving sow lifetime productivity is essential for maximizing farm profit-ability. Study objectives were to determine the accuracy for different vulva scoring methods in a commercial production system and to assess whether gilt reproductive tract scoring [evaluated by vulva width (VW)] prior to puberty could serve as useful gilt selection criteria. To accomplish this objective, 958 prepubertal replacement gilts in a commercial system were evaluated at approximately 15 wk of age. Gilt body weight (BW) was recorded in addition to 4 different methods to evaluate VW. Methods for VW assessment included digital caliper measurement (mm), visual evaluation and scoring by trained farm personnel [Farm Score (FS)], and 2 methods using scoring tools [Vulva Score Method A and B (VSA and VSB, respectively)] specifically calibrated from the VW distribution measured on gilts from previous studies. The VSA and FS methods assigned gilts to one of 3 categories (S, M, L, and 1, 2, 3, respectively) whereas VSB classified gilts vulvas using a 5-point scoring system (1 to 5). At 15 wk of age, a low proportion of variability in vulva size (27.8 +/- 0.1 mm) could be explained by BW (62.2 +/- 0.2 kg; R-2 = 0.05). All 3 scoring methods were effective in categorizing gilts based upon VW, as the measured VW size within methods differed by score (P < 0.01). The proportion of gilts achieving their first parity increased with score for VSA (64.7%, 73.2%, and 84.4%; P = 0.02), VSB (66.0%, 71.7%, 79.2%, 76.4%, and 84.2%; P = 0.02), and FS (67.2%, 75.0%, and 88.8%; P = 0.03), but VSA, VSB, and FS did not influence percentage of gilts achieving their second parity (P = 0.32, 0.29, and 0.30, respectively). Litter performance of gilts scored as M or L using VSA improved with an increased total born over 2 parities compared to those scored as S (23.96 vs. 26.38 pigs; P < 0.01) as well as born alive (21.13 vs. 23.05 pigs; P < 0.05). Results were similar for VSB, where scores 2 to 5 had greater total born (23.97 vs. 26.33 pigs; P < 0.01) and born alive (21.11 vs. 23.02 pigs; P < 0.05) through 2 parities compared to gilts scored 1. Using the FS method, total born pigs tended to be increased (P = 0.06) through 2 parities for gilts having a 2 or 3 vulva score compared to those scored as a 1. Collectively, assessing VW at approximately 15 wk of age may identify sows with improved productivity through 2 parities as breeding herd females.

Role of glucuronidated 25-hydroxyvitamin D on colon gene expression in mice	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-GASTROINTESTINAL AND LIVER PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						calcifediol; colon calcium absorption; glucuronic acid; 25-hydroxyvitamin D; vitamin D	VITAMIN-D-RECEPTOR; ENTEROHEPATIC CIRCULATION; CALCIUM-ABSORPTION; D-3; 1,25-DIHYDROXYVITAMIN-D3; PHYSIOLOGY; KNOCKOUT; DELIVERY; CECUM	25-Hydroxyvitamin D-3-3 beta-glucuronic acid (25OHD-Gluc) is produced in the liver and is a constituent of human blood and bile. Bacterial glucuronidases (GUS) in mammalian digestive microbiota cleave glucuronide conjugates, such as 25OHD-Gluc, and release the free aglycone (i.e., 25OHD) inside the intestinal lumen. We hypothesized that 25OHD-Gluc would elicit a VDR-dependent mRNA response in the colon after cleavage by gut microbiota. The activity of 25OHD-Gluc was investigated by measuring expression of cytochrome P450 24A1 (Cyp24) mRNA both in vitro and in vivo. In cell culture, Caco2 cells responded to 25OHD-Glut, whereas HT29 cells did not. When coincubated with GUS, both cell lines elicited a robust response as indicated by a 5 Ct (32-fold) increase in Cyp24 mRNA. In vitamin D-sufficient mice, we found that both oral and subcutaneous administration of 1 nmol 25OHD-Gluc induced expression of Cyp24 mRNA in the colon whereas 25OHD did not. In contrast. 25OHD, but not 25OHD-Gluc, was active in the duodenum. When the jejunum was surgically ligated to block flow of digesta to the colon, neither oral nor subcutaneous administration of 2 nmol 25OHD-Gluc was able to induce expression of Cyp24 in the colon. Our findings suggest that 25OHD-Gluc, a vitamin D metabolite found in bile, induces VDR-mediated responses in the colon by crossing the apical membrane of the colon epithelium. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We found that 25OHD-Gluc, an endogenously produced metabolite, is delivered to the colon via bile to induce vitamin D-mediated responses in the colon.

The methodology is specifically useful for large and geometrically complex structures that could not be modeled with reasonable scales in the limited number of tornado simulation facilities across the world. For this purpose, the experimentally developed tornado wind speed profiles were extracted from a laboratory tornado wind field and aerodynamic force coefficients of different segments of a lattice tower structure were assessed for various wind directions in a wind tunnel. The proposed method was then used to calculate the wind forces in the time domain on the model lattice tower for different orientation angles with respect to the tornado's mean path based on the empirical tornado wind speed profiles and the measured aerodynamic force coefficient of each tower segment, where the wind field at the tower location was updated at each time step as the tornado went past the tower. A tornado laboratory simulation test was conducted to measure the wind loads on a scaled model of a lattice tower subject to a translating tornado for the purpose of validation of the proposed method. The moving average of the horizontal wind force on the lattice tower model that was calculated with this method compared very well with that measured in a laboratory tornado simulator, which paves the way for the use of straight-line wind tunnels to assess tornado-induced loads on a lattice structure and possibly other similar structures.

Leidenfrost behavior in drop-wall impacts at combustor-relevant ambient pressures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER			English	Article						Drop-wall impact; Film boiling; Leidenfrost effect	MAXIMUM SPREADING DIAMETER; THERMAL ATOMIZATION; LIQUID DROPLETS; HEAT-TRANSFER; SURFACE; WATER; EVAPORATION; DYNAMICS; POINT	Liquid-fueled combustion systems demand optimal performance over a range of operating conditions- requiring predictable fuel injection events, spray breakup, and vaporization across a range of temperatures and pressures. In direct injection combustors, these sprays impinge directly on combustion chamber surfaces. Although the outcome of fuel droplets impacting a wall is primarily driven by the wall temperature and the Leidenfrost effect, the shifting liquid-vapor saturation point with pressure may influence the droplet-wall heat transfer rate and transition from nucleate to film boiling. In this paper, the role of ambient pressure on the droplet impact regimes, spreading rate, and droplet rebound velocity during impact are explored for representative low boiling point and high boiling point pure hydrocarbon liquids (n-heptane and n-decane). High-speed image sequences of the drop-wall impact were acquired for ambient pressures of 1-20 bar and wall temperatures ranging from 35-300 degrees C with a drop Weber number of similar to 50. Droplet impact sequences were recorded using a high-speed CMOS camera and were processed to measure the droplet spread, droplet rebound velocity and track the droplet centroid motion. The dynamics of the drop spreading and rebound show similar behavior across a range of ambient pressures with the largest differences observed for wetted versus non-wetted cases (above the Leidenfrost temperature). For both fluids, the onset of drop rebound remains bounded by the saturation temperature (shifting with ambient pressure) and the thermodynamic limit of liquid superheat. This leads to a decrease in the superheat temperature above the saturation point as the critical pressure is approached. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, it is not straightforward to correlate ink properties to the printing results. In this study, several parameters were identified and analyzed to evaluate the droplet behavior in electrohydrodynamic inkjet printing. More specifically, the effects of metallic nanoparticle sizes in the ink formulation were explored through the analysis of droplet impact behaviors. These parameters include droplet wetting diameter, height, initial impact velocity, and contact angle. With the assistance of machine vision, a high-speed camera captured a sequence of images, which were analyzed to extract the aforementioned parameters. Under fields of gravitational force with/without electric force, four phases of ink droplet behaviors were identified. Our data suggest that with an electric force field, particle size dominates the droplet behavior in respect to contact angle and wetting diameter. The increase of particle size decreased the droplet wetting diameter with an electric field, while increased the droplet wetting diameter without the electric field applied. Larger droplet size resulted in higher bouncing frequency and lower droplet height. Furthermore, under both gravitational and electrical fields, the droplet with medium particle size (average diameter of 276 nm) had a higher impact velocity than that with small (average diameter of 140 nm) and big (average diameter of 1517 nm) particle sizes. This study contributes to fundamental understanding of particle size effects. The results will help optimize ink formulations when designing new ink materials for electrohydrodynamic inkjet printing.

Watershed and in-lake restoration are used to improve the physical, chemical, and biological condition of lakes, but their success is rarely evaluated. Our objectives were to compare water quality and biological conditions following in-lake, watershed, or a combination of both restoration activities in 20 lakes throughout Iowa, USA compared to reference systems. Lake-specific responses to restoration were variable, making it challenging to detect systematic effects in water quality parameters. Secchi depth generally improved following restoration, particularly in natural in-lake restorations and following sediment removal, fishery renovation, and with the number of restoration practices implemented, but improvements were not sustained. Restoration also tended to reduce nutrient and plankton concentrations and relative abundance of some benthic fishes. Due to the prolonged degradation of eutrophic lakes, it may be unrealistic to expect immediate and long-lasting water quality improvements. In-lake restoration in natural lakes may be the most likely to have detectable effects, but our results also highlight the need for improved restoration documentation and additional research to identify factors associated with restoration success. Our results are useful for guiding lake restoration practices and educating lake users and stakeholders on expected restoration outcomes.

Using a near population of federal correctional clients selected from the Midwestern United States, the current study examined the association of chronic delinquent offender status on assorted life outcomes at midlife (average age of offenders was nearly 44 years). Although just 16% of the current offenders were formerly chronic delinquents, they accounted for 13.9% of current employment, 54.6% of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) cases, 54% of those at the 90th percentile for arrest charges, 45.8% of those at the 90th percentile for assaultive arrest charges, 53% of gang activity, 43.8% of lifetime traumatic brain injury, and 22.9% of lifetime mental illness. Logistic regression models indicated that former chronic delinquency was associated with 41% reduced odds of employment, 897% increased odds of ASPD, 81% increased odds of 90th percentile offending, 82% increased odds of 90th percentile assaultive offending, 144% increased odds of gang activity, 115% increased odds of traumatic brain injury, and 141% increased odds of lifetime mental illness. Former chronic delinquency has more consistent predictive validity among males than females and among Whites than African Americans. Multifinality is a useful concept to understand the developmental course of chronic delinquency and assess noncriminal yet nevertheless socially and societally burdensome outcomes.

Rheological attributes of myofibrillar protein solutions during thermal gelation and cooling were evaluated. All sources exhibited gelation with increased temperature (decreased 8). In all three treatments, a peak, decline, and subsequent increase in both the G' and G" was observed in the 50-55 degrees C range, with peak values being higher for CBT than for both MSCs. G' slopes on both sides of the peak (S2, S3) and following the decline (S4) were significantly different between CBT and both MSCs (P < 0.05) and indicated greater instability of the solid-like structure in the temperature range of 50-55 degrees C (myosin rod denaturation). Myofibrillar protein profiles confirmed fiber type differences among materials, as well as greater myosin fragmentation or modification in the MSC samples.

This study investigates the possible use of epoxy asphalt to stiffen the thin deck/pavement composite, minimise deflection and ultimately fatigue failure. Three different epoxy asphalt binders were used and two pavement mix designs were employed. The binder and pavement mixture properties were evaluated by direct tensile and pull-off strength test on the binder, Marshall test of the paving mixture and flexural fatigue tests of paving mixture on steel plates. Test results show that a relatively high modulus binder and a relatively stiff pavement can effectively reduce the composite's deflection and improve fatigue resistance on a relatively thin steel plate. Binder adhesion to the aggregate in the composite seems to play a pivotal role and the strength of this bond may have a close relationship with the stiffness of the pavement.

A well developed corn ear can have up to 800 kernels, but manually counting the kernels on an ear of corn is labor-intensive, time consuming and prone to human error. From an algorithmic perspective, the detection of the kernels from a single corn ear image is challenging due to the large number of kernels at different angles and very small distance among the kernels. In this paper, we propose a kernel detection and counting method based on a sliding window approach. The proposed method detects and counts all corn kernels in a single corn ear image taken in uncontrolled lighting conditions. The sliding window approach uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for kernel detection. Then, a non-maximum suppression (NMS) is applied to remove overlapping detections. Finally, windows that are classified as kernel are passed to another CNN regression model for finding the <mml:semantics>(x,y)</mml:semantics> coordinates of the center of kernel image patches. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method can successfully detect the corn kernels with a low detection error and is also able to detect kernels on a batch of corn ears positioned at different angles.

Nutrient supplementation effects on pig performance and sickness behavior during a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection	JOURNAL OF SWINE HEALTH AND PRODUCTION			English	Article						swine; porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus; sickness behavior; welfare; growth	IMMUNE-RESPONSE; VIRAL REPLICATION; GROWTH	Objective: Investigate how nutrient additive inclusion impacts performance and sickness behavior in pigs infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Materials and methods: At 10 weeks of age, 108 PRRSV naive barrows (mean [SD] body weight: 31 [1.4] kg) were allotted into 18 pens in a commercial barn and enrolled in a 35-day PRRSV challenge study. After a 5-day acclimation period, all pigs were inoculated intranasally and intramuscularly with a field strain of PRRSV and began nutrient supplement treatments. Treatments included no nutrient supplement (control; n = 6 pens), water nutrient supplement (water; n = 6 pens), and water and feed nutrient supplement (water+feed; n = 6 pens). Pen performance was recorded weekly at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days post inoculation (dpi). Pig home-pen behavior was recorded on -1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 dpi. Results: Over the 35-day challenge, no significant differences in pig viremia or performance were reported due to treatment. Compared to control, water+feed additive increased sitting in pigs; however, no other sickness behavior treatment differences were observed. Decreased activity was observed 6 and 9 dpi. Eating was decreased 6 dpi whereas drinking was decreased from 6 dpi throughout the rest of the behavioral observation period at 18 dpi.

Recent studies indicated that long-term increases in roughness for pavements could also be largely related to curling and warping changes. The objective of this study is to investigate behaviours of idealised curling profile and resulting values of parameter pseudo-strain gradient (PSG) in the frequency domain from profiles acquired from 30 sections to offer supplementary information on the characteristics of curling profile of interest. Advanced wavelet techniques, including both continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT), were utilised to decompose profiles into different layers of details in corresponding frequency bands for analysis. A quarter-car (QC) model was applied to simulate each decomposed layer, then frequency-domain changes in PSG and International Roughness Index (IRI) were compared, with results indicating that roughness resulting from curling profile could be strongly correlated to PSG in the frequency domain. The standard deviation for the level of details from DWT also shows a better correlation to PSG than IRI in the spatial domain. The dominated frequency band for curling profile was identified to be 0.12-1.25 circle/m. Differences between CWT and DWT for profile filtering were also discussed.

Improved endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent skin vasodilator responses following remote ischemic preconditioning	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						acetylcholine; iontophoresis; laser speckle contrast imaging; local heating; sodium nitroprusside	HUMAN CUTANEOUS CIRCULATION; NITRIC-OXIDE; MEDIATED VASODILATION; LASER-DOPPLER; MICROVASCULAR FUNCTION; BLOOD-FLOW; LATE-PHASE; ACETYLCHOLINE; IONTOPHORESIS; REPERFUSION	One week of daily remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) improves cutaneous vasodilatory (VD) function. However, the underlying mechanisms and the number of sessions needed to optimize this adaptive response remain unclear. We hypothesized that the responses to localized heating of the skin will be greater after 2 wk as opposed to 1 wk of RIPC. Furthermore, 2 wk of repeated RIPC will augment cutaneous VD responses to thermal and pharmacological stimuli. In METHODS, twenty-four participants (24 +/- 2 yr; 13 men, 11 women) performed repeated RIPC (7 daily sessions over 1 wk, n = 11; 12 sessions over 2 wk, n = 13), consisting of four repetitions of 5 min of arm blood flow occlusion separated by 5 min reperfusion. Laser speckle contrast imaging was used to measure skin blood flow responses, in perfusion units (PU), to local heating (T-loc = 42 degrees C), acetylcholine (ACh), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) before and after repeated RIPC. Data were expressed as cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC, in PU/mmHg). In RESULTS, the VD response to local heating increased after RIPC (Delta CVC from baseline; 1 wk: 0.94 +/- 0.11 to 1.19 +/- 0.15, 2 wk: 1.18 +/- 0.07 to 1.33 +/- 0.10 PU/mmHg; P < 0.05) but the Delta CVC did not differ between weeks. SNP-induced VD increased after 2 wk of RIPC (Delta CVC; 0.34 +/- 0.07 to 0.63 +/- 0.11 PU/mmHg; P < 0.05), but ACh-induced VD did not. In conclusion, repeated RIPC improves local heating- and SNPmediated cutaneous VD. When compared with 1 wk of RIPC, 2 wk of RIPC does not induce further improvements in cutaneous VD function. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Repeated RIPC increases the cutaneous vasodilatory response to local heating and to sodium nitroprusside but not to acetylcholine. Thus, endothelial-independent and local heating-mediated cutaneous vasodilation are improved following RIPC. However, 2 wk of RIPC sessions are not more effective than 1 wk of RIPC sessions in enhancing local heating-mediated cutaneous vasodilation.

Most existing validation methods suffer from two main limitations: (i) they are often highly sensitive to the experimental measurement uncertainty, and (ii) extending these methods for reliability model validation requires large quantities of failure data that may be very timeconsuming or costly to obtain. In order to overcome the aforementioned limitations, this study proposes an indirect reliability model validation method. First, a new procedure for computing a validation metric is developed based on Richardson extrapolation (RE) to reduce the sensitivity of the metric to the experimental measurement uncertainty. Second, a new validation metric is defined based on the limit state function (LSF) approximation to extend numerical model validation to reliability model validation. The proposed method is illustrated by validating a reliability estimation model for a cantilever beam under a vertical load.'

Phylogenetically aligned component analysis	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						multivariate; ordination; phylogenetic; principal component; singular value decomposition	MORPHOLOGICAL DIVERSIFICATION; ECOMORPHOLOGICAL CONVERGENCE; PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS; LEAST-SQUARES; R PACKAGE; SHAPE; EVOLUTION; PHYLOGENIES; MODELS; SIGNAL	It has become common in evolutionary biology to characterize phenotypes multivariately. However, visualizing macroevolutionary trends in multivariate datasets requires appropriate ordination methods. In this paper we describe phylogenetically aligned component analysis (PACA): a new ordination approach that aligns phenotypic data with phylogenetic signal. Unlike phylogenetic principal component analysis (Phy-PCA), which finds an alignment of a principal eigenvector that is independent of phylogenetic signal, PACA maximizes variation in directions that describe phylogenetic signal, while simultaneously preserving the Euclidean distances among observations in the data space. We demonstrate with simulated and empirical examples that with PACA, it is possible to visualize the trend in phylogenetic signal in multivariate data spaces, irrespective of other signals in the data. In conjunction with Phy-PCA, one can visualize both phylogenetic signal and trends in data independent of phylogenetic signal. Phylogenetically aligned component analysis can distinguish between weak phylogenetic signals and strong signals concentrated in only a portion of all data dimensions. We provide empirical examples that emphasize the difference. Use of PACA in studies focused on phylogenetic signal should enable much more precise description of the phylogenetic signal, as a result. Overall, PACA will return a projection that shows the most phylogenetic signal in the first few components, irrespective of other signals in the data. By comparing Phy-PCA and PACA results, one may glean the relative importance of phylogenetic and other (ecological) signals in the data.

Muskellunge Survival, Interbasin Movement, and Emigration in a Simple and a Complex Interconnected Glacial Lake	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article							ADULT MUSKELLUNGE; ESOX-MASQUINONGY; WALLEYE; POPULATION; MANAGEMENT; WISCONSIN; FISHERIES; ECOLOGY; CHAIN; ESCAPEMENT	Glacial lakes can display a wide range of morphometries that may affect fish movements and population dynamics. MuskellungeEsox masquinongyis a popular sportfish that is long-lived and occurs at low densities, making population abundance susceptible to sources of fish loss. Yet, factors influencing Muskellunge survival, movement, and emigration in lakes of different morphometric complexities are unknown. We used capture histories of nearly 5,700 individual adult (age >= 3; >= 610 mm) Muskellunge collected from a simple (single shallow lake, bowl-shaped basin with simple shoreline) and a complex (multiple basins with greater habitat diversity) lake basin over 17 years to quantify survival, interbasin movement, and emigration from these systems and evaluate if these parameters were related to population density or water level metrics. Adult Muskellunge annual survival within the interconnected lake chain varied through time and among connected lakes (range = 0.57-0.95), whereas survival was similar among years in the simple lake basin (0.90; 95% CI = 0.85-0.96). Muskellunge movement probabilities within an interconnected lake chain ranged from 0.02 to 0.22 and increased in two systems but decreased in one system with maximum ice-out water level over crest. Similarly, annual Muskellunge emigration ranged from 0.02 to 0.16 from an interconnected lake chain and from 0.00 to 0.28 in a simple lake and increased in both systems with increasing water levels following ice-out. These results demonstrate that Muskellunge movement within and emigration from lakes as a function of ice-out water levels can be an important source of fish loss (either temporary or permanent) from glacial lakes. Information on movement and emigration may help managers mitigate these losses via supplemental stocking or reduced harvest quotas, whereas constructing barriers may be a necessary component of Muskellunge management in other lake systems.

Ecology of Porcine Astrovirus Type 3 in a Herd with Associated Neurologic Disease	VIRUSES-BASEL			English	Article						astrovirus; porcine astrovirus type 3; neurologic disease; longitudinal study; swine	GENETIC-CHARACTERIZATION; PIGS; ENCEPHALITIS; KOBUVIRUSES; INFECTION; DIAGNOSIS; DIARRHEA; VIRUS	Astroviruses (AstVs) cause disease in a wide variety of species. Porcine AstVs are highly genetically diverse and conventionally assigned to five genetic lineages (PoAstV1-5). Due to the increasing evidence that porcine astrovirus type 3 (PoAstV3) is a cause of encephalomyelitis in swine and to elucidate important ecologic characteristics, the infection dynamics and environmental distribution of PoAstV3 were investigated in a herd with PoAstV3-associated neurologic disease. Over a 22 week period, the frequency of PoAstV3 fecal shedding varied by pig and age. The peak detection by RT-qPCR of PoAstV3 on fecal swabs (95%; 61 of 64) occurred at 3 weeks of age. The lowest frequency of detection was at 21 weeks of age (4%; 2 of 47); however, the frequency increased to 41% (19 of 46) at the final sampling time point (25 weeks of age). Viremia was rare (0.9%: 4 of 433). Detection in oral fluid was consistent with 75% to 100% of samples positive at each time point. Pens and feeders also had a high rate of detection with a majority of samples positive at a majority of sampling time points. Based on the data presented, PoAstV3 can be consistently detected in the environment with a majority of pigs being infected and a subset intermittently shedding the virus in feces out to 25 weeks of age. These findings suggest the importance of as-yet unidentified risk factors associated with the development of PoAstV3-associated polioencephalomyelitis.

Xylanase increased the energetic contribution of fiber and improved the oxidative status, gut barrier integrity, and growth performance of growing pigs fed insoluble corn-based fiber	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						antioxidant capacity; arabinoxylan-oligosaccharide; corn bran; insoluble fiber; pig; xylanase	NUTRIENT DIGESTIBILITY; FERULIC ACID; MICROBIOTA; NURSERY; WHEAT; FEED; NUTRITION; RESPONSES; RELEASE; ENZYMES	The experimental objective was to investigate the impact of xylanase on the bioavailability of energy, oxidative status, and gut function of growing pigs fed a diet high in insoluble fiber and given a longer adaptation time than typically reported. Three replicates of 20 gilts with an initial body weight (BW) of 25.43 +/- 0.88 kg were blocked by BW, individually housed, and randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments: a low-fiber control (LF) with 7.5% neutral detergent fiber (NDF), a 30% corn bran without solubles high-fiber control (HF; 21.9% NDF), HF + 100 mg/kg xylanase (HF + XY; Econase XT 25P), and HF + 50 mg/kg arabinoxylan-oligosaccharide (HF + AX). Gilts were fed ad libitum for 36 d across two dietary phases. Pigs and feeders were weighed on days 0, 14, 27, and 36. On day 36, pigs were housed in metabolism crates for a 10-d period, limit fed (80% of average ad libitum intake), and feces and urine were collected the last 72 h to determine the digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME). On day 46, serum and ileal and colonic tissue were collected. Data were analyzed as a linear mixed model with block and replication as random effects, and treatment, time, and treatment x time as fixed effects. There was a significant treatment x time interaction for BW, average daily gain (ADG), and gain to feed (G:F; P < 0.001). By design, BW at day 0 did not differ; at day 14, pigs fed LF were 3.5% heavier, and pigs fed HF + XY, when compared with HF, were 4% and 4.2% heavier at days 27 and 36, respectively (P < 0.001). From day 14 to 27 and day 27 to 36, when compared with HF, HF + XY improved ADG by 12.4% and 10.7% and G:F by 13.8% and 8.8%, respectively (P < 0.05). Compared with LF, HF decreased DE and ME by 0.51 and 0.42 Mcal/kg, respectively, but xylanase partially mitigated that effect by increasing DE and ME by 0.15 and 0.12 Mcal/kg, over HF, respectively (P < 0.05). Pigs fed HF + XY had increased total antioxidant capacity in the serum and ileum (P < 0.05) and tended to have less circulating malondialdehyde (P = 0.098). Pigs fed LF had increased ileal villus height, and HF + XY and HF + AX had shallower intestinal crypts (P < 0.001). Pigs fed HF + XY had increased ileal messenger ribonucleic acid abundance of claudin 4 and occludin (P < 0.05). Xylanase, but not AX, improved the growth performance of pigs fed insoluble corn-based fiber. This was likely a result of the observed increase in ME, improved antioxidant capacity, and enhanced gut barrier integrity, but it may require increased adaptation time to elicit this response.

Effects of a mannan-rich yeast cell wall-derived preparation on cecal concentrations and tissue prevalence of Salmonella Enteritidis in layer chickens	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TYPHIMURIUM COLONIZATION; BROILER; CONTAMINATION; FRACTIONS; SPP.; FOOD	Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) has been the most common Salmonella serotype associated with foodborne infections in the last several years. Dietary applications of yeast-based preparations in feed have shown to reduce Salmonella colonization in chickens augmenting SE control strategies. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a mannan-rich yeast cell wall-derived preparation (Actigen (R)) administered in feed at a rate of 400 g/ton on SE colonization in the cecum and internal organs of commercial layer chickens. Sixteen week-old layer pullets were orally challenged with a selected nalidixic acid resistant SE strain at a dose of 1.7x10<^>9 colony forming units (CFU) per bird. SE colonization was assessed by evaluating isolation rates from ovary and pooled liver/spleen samples as well as enumeration of SE in cecal pouches one week post-challenge. Recovery rates of SE from the ovaries of directly challenged birds receiving Actigen (R) were significantly lower (P < 0.02) than those in directly challenged birds fed an unsupplemented control diet. Recovery rates of SE from pooled liver/spleen samples were not significantly different between Actigen (R)-treated pullets and controls (P = 0.22). Using direct plate count methods, cecal SE concentrations were 1 log(10) lower (P < 0.001) in challenged pullets in the Actigen (R)-supplemented group than in the challenged controls. The SE concentration distributions in the ceca were similar in groups testing positive and groups testing negative for SE in the ovaries and liver/spleens tissues. As a result, SE concentrations in the ceca could not be directly related to the occurrence or prevalence of SE in these tissues. In conclusion, Actigen (R) supplementation appears to decrease the prevalence of SE in ovarian tissue and concentrations of SE in cecal contents and may be useful as a tool for reducing the risk of eggshell contamination and transovarian transmission of SE in eggs.

The Ties That Bind: Britain's Use of Scottish Highland Dress	CLOTHING AND TEXTILES RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article						Scotland; kilt; tartan; Highland dress; British		For over 300 years, Britain has influenced Scotland's national identity. Scottish Highland dress, which consists of kilts and tartans has been appropriated, manipulated, and transformed by the British in order to forward political, commercial, and social objectives. Scotland's national dress has contributed to a more cohesive identity within the United Kingdom. However, available research only examines specific instances of British influence on-and usage of-kilts and tartans. The purpose of this study was to identify and explore a sample of key figures and historical events that illustrate the use of Scottish Highland dress to forward British interests. The researchers triangulated databases and secondary literature along with extant objects and materials, with the aim of developing a more holistic understanding of appropriation, manipulation, and transformation. Findings indicate how the context and usage of Scottish Highland dress was transformed over time.

Merr) to PS-Foundation 1-0-1 Biostimulant, Triple Super Phosphate, and Rhizobium Inoculant	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS			English	Article						Soybean; biostimulant; rhizobia; inoculant	BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS; GUINEA SAVANNA; IMPROVEMENT; YIELD; ZONE	Soybean yields in Ghana are low and stagnant in spite of the trio of recommendations: (1) improved seed, (2) rhizobium inoculant and (3) phosphorous fertilizer application being promoted by government to boost productivity. This study evaluates the response of soybean to Pro-soil biostimulant, triple super phosphate (TSP), and rhizobium inoculant in the interior savanna of Ghana. A treatment structure comprising two mainplot factors (biostimulant and conventional), and four subplots factors; TSP, inoculant, TSP+Inoculant and unamended control arranged in a split-plot design was used for this study. Apart from dry matter which increased by 42%, Pro-soil biostimulant as a stand-alone management practice did not significantly increase agronomic parameters measured in this study. Biostimulant did not have a significant effect on grain yield, nodule weight, nodule number, canopy diameter, and plant height. Application of TSP alone, and in combination with inoculant, significantly increased yield, plant dry matter, nodule weight, nodule number, and dry pod weight. Highest soybean yield was obtained from TSP + Inoculant treatment, averaging 3.6 t ha(-1) compared to 1.8 t ha(-1) for control. Biostimulant, TSP+Inoculant combination resulted in yields as high as 4 t ha(-1). Overall, the results indicate that neither PS-Foundation biostimulant nor rhizobia inoculation can be used as stand-alone management practices to increase soybean yield. However, an integrated application of PS-Foundation biostimulant, TSP, and inoculant could double current soybean yields in Ghana.	[Avornyo, V.

Impact of screw thread shape on stress transfer in bone: a finite element study	COMPUTER METHODS IN BIOMECHANICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Magnesium; finite element analysis; stress concentration	PULLOUT STRENGTH; MINERAL DENSITY; MAGNESIUM; PREDICTION; RESORPTION; FIXATION; IMPLANTS	Gradual screw loosening is a well-known failure mechanism in internal fixation. Loosening is primarily due to progressive bone loss caused by stress shielding, a phenomenon in which a medical device absorbs a disproportionate amount of load within the screw-bone construct. The proximity of elastic moduli of magnesium and bone presents the potential for alleviating screw loosening by allowing optimum stress to be transferred between screw and bone, and in turn, supporting bone remodeling around the screw. In this study, the effect of thread profile on stress transfer in a magnesium fixation was simulated using a 2-D finite element model. Modified stress parameters from a previous study were used to estimate stress transfer across three thread profiles. Results showed highest stress transfer in trapezoidal-shaped magnesium screw thread. In accordance, this study corroborates the potential for magnesium as an ultimate screw material to eliminate progressive screw loosening.

A clustering method for graphical handwriting components and statistical writership analysis	STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MINING			English	Article						Bayesian; clustering; forensic statistics; handwriting analysis; hierarchical modeling	ALGORITHM	Handwritten documents can be characterized by their content or by the shape of the written characters. We focus on the problem of comparing a person's handwriting to a document of unknown provenance using the shape of the writing, as is done in forensic applications. To do so, we first propose a method for processing scanned handwritten documents to decompose the writing into small graphical structures, often corresponding to letters. We then introduce a measure of distance between two such structures that is inspired by the graph edit distance, and a measure of center for a collection of the graphs. These measurements are the basis for an outlier tolerant K-means algorithm to cluster the graphs based on structural attributes, thus creating a template for sorting new documents. Finally, we present a Bayesian hierarchical model to capture the propensity of a writer for producing graphs that are assigned to certain clusters. We illustrate the methods using documents from the Computer Vision Lab dataset. We show results of the identification task under the cluster assignments and compare to the same modeling, but with a less flexible grouping method that is not tolerant of incidental strokes or outliers.

Evaluating the efficacy of visual assessment of gilt vulva size prior to puberty on subsequent reproductive performance	APPLIED ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						sow lifetime productivity; vulva size; litter size; gilt	AGE; ESTRUS; PRODUCTIVITY; SELECTION; MEISHAN; GROWTH	Objective: This study's objective was to assess the relationship between visually assigned prepubertal vulva score and subsequent sow productivity in a commercial production system. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted at a genetic nucleus herd, where farm personnel visually classified prepubertal gilts into categories: vulva score 1 (VS1; below average size), VS2 (average vulva size), and VS3 (above average vulva size), at approximately 15 wk of age. Reproductive performance from gilts incorporated into the breeding herd were tracked through 2 parities of production. Results and Discussion: Age at parity 1 (P1) was greatest (P <= 0.01) in gilts assigned a VS1 score compared with those receiving a VS2 or VS3 score. The P1 total pigs born for gilts categorized as VS2, VS3, and VS2/3 (VS2 and VS3 combined into one group) was greater (P <= 0.05) compared with gilts receiving a score of VS1. The number of pigs born alive was also lower (P <= 0.05) for gilts assigned a VS1 compared with those assigned VS2 or VS3 and the combined group (VS2/3). Second parity litter performance was not affected (P > 0.18) by prepubertal vulva score assigmnent, although total pigs born and pigs born alive through 2 parities combined tended to be greater (P <= 0.08) for gilts in the combined VS2/VS3 group compared with those assigned a score of VS1. Implications and Applications: These results suggest that visually assessing prepubertal vulva development may identify females more likely to farrow at a younger age with improved P1 litter performance.

J	Moradi, M; Li, Q				Moradi, Mohammad; Li, Qi			Rogue people: on adversarial crowdsourcing in the context of cyber security	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & ETHICS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Information security; Crowdsourcing; Human-computer interaction; Cyber security; Adversarial crowdsourcing	CAPTCHA	Purpose Over the past decade, many research works in various disciplines have benefited from the endless ocean of people and their potentials (in the form of crowdsourcing) as an effective problem-solving strategy and computational model. But nothing interesting is ever completely one-sided. Therefore, when it comes to leveraging people's power, as the dark side of crowdsourcing, there are some possible threats that have not been considered as should be, such as recruiting black hat crowdworkers for organizing targeted adversarial intentions. The purpose of this paper is to draw more attention to this critical issue through investigation of its different aspects. Design/methodology/approach To delve into details of such malicious intentions, the related literature and previous researches have been studied. Then, four major typologies for adversarial crowdsourced attacks as well as some real-world scenarios are discussed and delineated. Finally, possible future threats are introduced. Findings Despite many works on adversarial crowdsourcing, there are only a few specific research studies devoted to considering the issue in the context of cyber security. In this regard, the proposed typologies (and addressed scenarios) for such human-mediated attacks can shed light on the way of identifying and confronting such threats. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this the first work in which the titular topic is investigated in detail. Due to popularity and efficiency of leveraging crowds' intelligence and efforts in a wide range of application domains, it is most likely that adversarial human-driven intentions gain more attention. In this regard, it is anticipated that the present research study can serve as a roadmap for proposing defensive mechanisms to cope with such diverse threats.

Histologically, glossal skeletal muscle was infiltrated and effaced by islands of cartilage and streams of spindle-shaped cells. Retrospective analysis of 236 tongue masses submitted to the Iowa State University surgical biopsy service between 2011 and 2019 showed that the majority of submitted tongue masses are either non-neoplastic or benign, with granular cell tumors identified as the most prevalent benign neoplasms. Malignant tumors accounted for nearly 30% of all submitted masses, with malignant melanoma diagnosed most frequently.

The proposed approach relies on the linear lifting of a nonlinear system using linear Perron-Frobenius (P-F) and Koopman operators. The uncertainty can be characterized in terms of the moments of a probability density function. We demonstrate how the P-F and Koopman operators are used for propagating the moments. Time-series data is used for the finite-dimensional approximation of the linear operators, thereby enabling data-driven approach for moment propagation. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Communication-Efficient Network-Distributed Optimization with Differential-Coded Compressors	IEEE INFOCOM 2020 - IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS	IEEE INFOCOM		English	Proceedings Paper	39th IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)	JUL 06-09, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE				Network-distributed optimization has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its ever-increasing applications. However, the classic decentralized gradient descent (DGD) algorithm is communication-inefficient for large-scale and high-dimensional network-distributed optimization problems. To address this challenge, many compressed DGD-based algorithms have been proposed. However, most of the existing works have high complexity and assume compressors with bounded noise power. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a new differential-coded compressed DGD (DC-DGD) algorithm. The key features of DC-DGD include: i) DC-DGD works with general SNR-constrained compressors, relaxing the bounded noise power assumption; ii) The differential-coded design entails the same convergence rate as the original DGD algorithm; and iii) DC-DGD has the same low-complexity structure as the original DGD due to a self-noise-reduction effect. Moreover, the above features inspire us to develop a hybrid compression scheme that offers a systematic mechanism to minimize the communication cost. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of the proposed DC-DGD and hybrid compressor.

Based on the characteristic mode analysis, a circuit analog absorber is designed using a lossy frequency-selective surface (FSS) that consists of miniaturized meander lines and lumped resistors. The positions and values of resistors are determined according to the analysis of modal significances and modal current. After that, the presented rasorber is designed by cascading of the lossy FSS and a lossless bandpass FSS. Equivalent circuits of the FSR are modeled, and surface current distributions of both FSSs are illustrated to explain the operation mechanism. Measurement results show that, under the normal incidence, a minimum insertion loss of 0.27 dB is achieved at a passband around 6 GHz, and the absorption bands with an absorption rate higher than 80% are 2.5-4.6 GHz in the lower band and 7.7-12 GHz in the higher band, respectively. Our results exhibit good agreements between measurements and simulations.

A biphasic curve for modeling, classifying, and predicting egg production in single cycle and molted flocks	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						egg production curve; molt; layer chicken		Egg production on a flock level can be summarized into several phases determined by biology of individual birds: rapid increase in production reflecting achieving sexual maturity, peak production related to maximum laying potential, followed by gradual decrease in the rate of lay as the birds age. In 1989 Yang et al. proposed a mathematical model (modified compartmental model) to describe this process. In this study a biphasic modified compartmental model was proposed for modeling, classifying, and predicting egg production in single cycle and molted flocks. Goodness-of-fit was high for both single cycle (average R-2 = 0.99) and molted flocks (average R-2 = 0.97), suggesting that the model could be used for bench-marking molted flocks. The difference in R-2 between the biphasic model and the model used by Yang et al in 1989 can be used to differentiate between single cycle and molted flocks. The biphasic model was shown to predict future records well up to 8 wk in advance, but as with any regression model, caution is recommended when predicting records outside of the observed age range.

Collecting oral fluid samples from due-to-wean litters	PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE			English	Article						Swine; Oral fluids; Surveillance	RESPIRATORY-SYNDROME-VIRUS; INFLUENZA-A-VIRUS; ANTIBODY; SURVEILLANCE; INFECTION; SPECIMENS; SERUM; PRRSV; PIGS; PROBABILITY	Oral fluids are a common diagnostic sample in group-housed nursery, grow-finish, and adult swine. Although oral fluids from due-to-wean litters could be a valuable tool in monitoring pathogens and predicting the health status of pig populations post-weaning, it is generally not done because of inconsistent success in sample collection. The objective of this study was to determine the optimum procedure for collecting oral fluid samples from due-to-wean litters. Successful collection of oral fluids from due-to-wean litters using "Litter Oral Fluid" (LOF) or "Family Oral Fluid" (FOF) sampling techniques were compared in 4 phases involving 920 attempts to collect oral fluids. Phase 1 testing showed that prior exposure to a rope improved the success rates of both LOF (33.4%) and FOF (16.4%) techniques. Phase 2 determined that longer access to the rope (4 h vs 30 min) did not improve the success rate for either LOF or FOF. Phase 3 evaluated the effect of attractants and found that one (Baby Pig Restart (R)) improved the success rate when used with the FOF technique. Phase 4 compared the success rates of "optimized LOF" (litters previously trained) vs "optimized FOF" (litter previously trained and rope treated with Baby Pig Restart (R)) vs standard FOF. No difference was found between the FOF-based techniques, but both were superior to the "optimized LOF" technique. Thus, FOF-based procedures provided a significantly higher probability of collecting oral fluids from due-to-wean litters (mean success rate 84.9%, range 70% to 92%) when compared to LOF-based methods (mean success rate 24.1%, range 16.5% to 32.2%).

The maximum and root-mean-square (rms) errors on the right triangular, equilateral triangular, and rectangular (bivariate Lagrange polynomial) interpolations are analyzed. It is found that the maximum and rms errors are directly proportional to the (p + 1)th power of kh for both 1-D and (2-D, bivariate) interpolations, where k is the wavenumber and h is the mesh size. The interpolation regions for the right triangular, equilateral triangular, and rectangular interpolations are selected based on the regions with smallest errors. The triangular and rectangular interpolations are applied to evaluate the 2-D singly periodic Green's function. The numerical results show that the equilateral triangular interpolation is the most accurate interpolation method, whereas the right triangular interpolation is the most efficient interpolation method.

Probabilistic Approach to Integrating Thermal Effects in Camber and Stress Analyses of Concrete Beams	JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Camber; Finite-element model; Monte Carlo simulation; Multipliers; Precast pretensioned concrete beams; Stress; Thermal effects	PRECAST; DESIGN	The accuracy of camber and corresponding stresses of precast pretensioned concrete beams (PPCBs) is routinely compromised due to ignoring the thermal effects resulting from continuously changing weather conditions, affecting the deck placement on site. While accounting for the effects of a known temperature gradient down the beam depth is straightforward, the temperature gradient varies by region and meteorological season. Using Monte Carlo simulation to probabilistically determine the thermal effects, this study accounts for these variations in combination with the camber and stresses established for PPCBs subjected to dead load and prestress. To utilize the outcomes of this study in design practice, suitable thermal multipliers are proposed. Recommended multipliers produced more realistic camber predictions because the mean absolute error between the measured and predicted values was 5%+/- 5%. The corresponding error increased to 13%+/- 10% when the thermal multipliers were ignored. The impact of the thermal effects was relatively less on stresses, but it was observed that the stress on the beam's extreme compression fiber can exceed the allowable stresses in warm summer days.

The value of the hypergraph zero forcing number and maximum nullity are determined for various families of uniform hypergraphs and the effects of several graph operations on the hypergraph zero forcing number are determined. The hypergraph zero forcing number is compared to the infection number of a hypergraph and the iteration process in hypergraph power domination. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Performance of a Nageotte hemocytometer method and a flow cytometric assay for residual leukocyte quantification in leukoreduced canine packed red blood cells	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE			English	Article						blood banking; flow cytometry; hematology; pRBC; transfusion	TRANSFUSIONS; DOGS	Objective To evaluate the performances of a manual Nageotte hemocytometer method and commercial fluorescent bead-based flow cytometric assay for quantifying [rWBC] in leukoreduced canine packed red blood cell (pRBC) units. Design Prospective study. Five, commercially purchased, double leukoreduced canine pRBC units were spiked with canine leukocytes to create 6 pRBC standards with the following [rWBC]: < 0.1, 0.375, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, and 24.0 WBC/mu L. [rWBC] of each pRBC standard was measured with the Nageotte hemocytometer and flow cytometric techniques. Limit of detection (LoD), linearity, and bias were determined for each method. For each standard, accuracy and precision were calculated; the cumulative accuracy and mean precision for measurements between the LoD and 24.0 WBC/mu L were also determined. Setting University veterinary blood bank and clinical pathology laboratory. Measurements and Main Results The Nageotte hemocytometer method had an LoD = 1.48 WBC/mu L, inadequate linearity (R-2 = 0.92), and a significant negative proportional bias (slope best-fit line = 0.52 +/- 0.03). Between [rWBC] 1.5-24 WBC/mu L, the technique demonstrated poor cumulative accuracy (6.7%) but acceptable mean precision (17.3%). Relative to a 2 rWBC/mu L threshold, at 1.5 WBC/mu L the method was inaccurate (6.7%) with acceptable precision (16.6%). The flow cytometric assay had an LoD = 1.3 WBC/mu L, acceptable linearity (R-2 = 0.99), and a mild positive proportional bias (slope best-fit line = 1.11 +/- 0.01). The technique had acceptable cumulative accuracy (80%) and mean precision (10.7%) for measuring [rWBC] between 1.5 and 24 WBC/mu L. At 1.5 WBC/mu L, this method was acceptably accurate (86.7%) and precise (16.0%). Conclusions The flow cytometric assay demonstrated acceptable performance for quantification of [rWBC] in leukoreduced canine pRBC units. The Nageotte hemocytometer method should be used cautiously due to poor accuracy and significant negative bias.

ANIMALS 40 client-owned dogs (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification I or II and age >= 6 months) scheduled to undergo anesthesia for elective procedures. PROCEDURES In a randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trial, dogs received 2% lidocaine hydrochloride solution (2.0 mg/kg [0.9 mg/lb], IV; n = 20) or buffered crystalloid solution (0.1 mL/kg [0.05 mL/lb], IV; 20; control treatment) after premedication with acepromazine (0.005 mg/kg [0.002 mg/lb], IM) and hydromorphone (0.1 mg/kg, IM). Anesthesia was induced with propofol (1 mg/kg [0.45 mg/lb], IV, with additional doses administered as needed) and maintained with isoflurane. Sedation was assessed, and anesthetic and cardiopulmonary variables were measured at various points; values were compared between treatment groups. RESULTS Propofol doses, total sedation scores, and anesthetic and most cardiopulmonary measurements did not differ significantly between treatment groups over the monitoring period; only oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry differed significantly (lower in the lidocaine group). Mean +/- SD propofol dose required for endotracheal intubation was 1.30 +/- 0.68 mg/kg (0.59 +/- 0.31 mg/lb) and 1.41 +/- 0.40 mg/kg (0.64 +/- 0.18 mg/lb) for the lidocaine and control groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE No propofol-sparing effect was observed with administration of lidocaine as a coinduction agent for the premedicated dogs of this study. Mean propofol doses required for endotracheal intubation were considerably lower than currently recommended doses for premedicated dogs.	[Cazlan, Callie E.; Kraus, Bonnie L.

In a randomized controlled clinical efficacy and safety study in the United States, 85 of 116 dogs that received a single TT injection achieved complete response (CR) of the treated MCT by day 28. Objective To evaluate the durability of the TT treatment response achieved at day 28 in the U.S. study by assessing MCT recurrence at the treatment site 6 and 12 months after TT administration. Animals Eighty-five dogs previously treated with TT. Methods Dogs that achieved CR at day 28 were assessed retrospectively for the presence or absence of MCT at the treatment site using records from clinical visits and telephone interviews with owners. Dogs unavailable at an assessment time were considered lost-to-follow-up and data for their last assessment used in the final analysis. Results By 12 months after TT treatment, 64 dogs remained evaluable, with 21 unavailable. Of evaluable patients, 57 (89%) remained tumor free at the treatment site and 7 (11%) had developed recurrence. All recurrences occurred within the first 6 months, predominantly (5/7, 71%) within the first 12 weeks. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Tigilanol tiglate provided a durable long-term local response for the treatment of MCT in dogs.

Phytic Acid Protects from Oxidative Stress Induced by Iron-Overload and High-Fat Diets in ss2-Microglobulin Knockout Mice	MOLECULES			English	Article						phytic acid; oxidative stress; NTBI; high fat diet; genetic iron overload	HEREDITARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; ANTIOXIDANT STATUS; RADICAL FORMATION; LIVER OXIDANT; PHYTATE; METABOLISM; IP6; HEXAPHOSPHATE; INHIBITION	The objective of this study was to examine the protective effect of phytic acid (PA) in reducing oxidative stress in an animal model for human hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) fed high-fat diets. Sixty-four ss2 microglobulin knockout (beta 2m KO) mice were randomly assigned to three treatments by feeding: control (basal), atherogenic (AT), and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) diets. One-half of the mice in each treatment group were fed 2% (wt/wt) PA. The ss2m+/+ mice (wild type (WT)) were fed a basal diet. All seven groups were fed for 10 weeks with a 50-ppm iron-containing diet (AIN-93G). Free iron and lipids were measured in serum samples. Nonheme iron, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase concentrations were measured in the liver tissue. Nonheme iron concentration in ss2m KO mice (on the basal diet) was 20x higher (p < 0.0001) than in the WT mice. Compared to the WT mice, ss2m KO mice had a significantly higher concentration of free iron in the serum (p < 0.0001), six-fold higher hepatic TBARs (p < 0.0001), and 18% lower hepatic SOD level. When PA was added to the beta 2m KO basal diet, a reduction (26 to 50%) of iron concentration was seen in the liver and heart. The addition of PA also significantly reduced TBARs in all three dietary groups of the iron-overloaded group, but most effectively in the control group. An increase in SOD concentration was seen only in the PUFA group, but serum triacylglycerol (TG) concentration was reduced in both dietary fat groups. In conclusion, our results suggest that PA protects against oxidative stress-induced by genetic iron overload alone or when fed high fat.

J	Denizel, M; Suzuki, Y; Anderson, C				Denizel, Meltem; Suzuki, Yoshinori; Anderson, Christopher			Increasing Biofuel Proliferation via the Optimal Use of Government Incentives	TRANSPORTATION JOURNAL			English	Article						Biofuel; transportation; sustainability; optimization	SUPPLY CHAIN DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	With the increasing public awareness on global warming, the demand for low greenhouse gas emission (GHG) transportation fuel, such as biofuel, is growing rapidly. In the United States, like many other countries, the government is providing monetary incentives for biofuel displacement of fossil fuel. From the standpoint of biofuel proliferation, it is important that biofuel producers utilize these incentives in the most effective way, because better utilizations of incentives will lead to reduced costs for producers, which in turn will lower biofuel retail prices. Currently, however, biofuel producers are not taking full advantage of these incentives. This industry note introduces a new approach that allows US biofuel producers to improve their practice of using an incentive program called the LCFS (California Low Carbon Fuel Standard). Our method, which is relatively simple, is based on a recent research project conducted with a biofuel manufacturing firm, which aimed to maximize the benefit gained from the LCFS incentive program. We show, by performing numerical experiments with realistic settings, that the method matches or outperforms the current practice in terms of maximizing gains extracted from the incentive program, under all conditions.

The resistance factors provided nationally for LRFD of driven piles are relatively conservative. Therefore, the Iowa Department of Transportation and Iowa State University collaborated and established regional resistance factors that are more efficient than those provided in the AASHTO Specifications, which are complemented with improved construction control methods. Iowa's LRFD guidelines for piles have been used in enough completed projects since 2012, allowing an assessment of the accuracy of the regional resistance factors and construction control methods. The piles used in these projects included both end-bearing piles in rock and friction piles. The friction piles were installed in cohesive, noncohesive, and mixed soil sites. The evaluation for the different pile categories and soil types found that the regional LRFD resistance factors developed were successfully applied in Iowa's driven pile design and effectively reduced the piles' contract lengths, resulting in cost-benefit over AASHTO's recommended resistance factors.

J	Paterson, M; Clark, S				Paterson, Molly; Clark, Stephanie			Use of auctions to assess consumer value for milk from different packaging	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						high-density polyethylene (HDPE); oxidation; sensory; shelf life	WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; OXIDATION FLAVOR; ANIMAL-WELFARE; DAIRY-PRODUCTS; ALLERGY	The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a sensory experience and educational message on consumer value for fluid milk in different containers: translucent high-density polyethylene (HDPE), white-pigmented HDPE (light-block), and paperboard. We carried out 11 auction sessions (n = 100). Sessions included an explanation of the experiment process; a survey about demographics and milk purchasing and consumption behaviors; a sensory evaluation; an educational message; and 3 rounds of nth price auctions. Consumers were blindly served 2 pairs of milk samples-2% milk from paperboard and translucent HDPE, and skim milk from paperboard and translucent HDPE-and asked to indicate their preference and level of acceptability for each, using a 7-point hedonic scale. Consumers were asked to ascribe a monetary value to each sample. Consumers were also asked to taste and assess a value for 2% and skim milk from light-block HDPE. All milk samples were evaluated simultaneously by a panel of 9 judges who were trained to evaluate milk quality attributes on a 15 cm unstructured line scale. All milk was from the same industry source, processed and stored on the same timeline for each session. Results from the consumer panel on acceptability, trained panel descriptive analysis and consumer bids were analyzed using multi-factor ANOVA. Subjecting responses to pre- and post-surveys to k means cluster analysis revealed 4 bidding populations in each round. Trained panelists detected higher levels of light-oxidized off-flavor in skim milk from translucent HDPE (5.8 cm) than from light-block HDPE (2.42 cm) and in 2% milk from translucent HDPE (5.1 cm) than from paperboard (0.32 cm). Although 84% of participants regularly purchased milk in plastic containers, consumers' acceptability scores for milk of the same fat content but from different packaging were not different. However, consumers gave higher acceptability scores from paperboard (4.7/7.0). We found no differences in consumer value (US$) for 2% or skim milk in paperboard or translucent HDPE. However, after consumers received an educational message and tasted "Certified Fresh Taste" samples, they were willing to pay more for 2% milk in paperboard ($0.31 more) or HDPE ($0.38 more) packaging with a "Certified Fresh Taste" seal and for skim milk in paperboard ($0.15 more) or HDPE ($0.21 more) packaging with a "Certified Fresh Taste" seal than for milk in packaging without such labeling. Although consumers could not detect a difference in the milk from different packages, they indicated that they would pay more for a "Certified Fresh Taste" seal after hearing about the effects of light on milk in different packaging, demonstrating the importance to consumers of external cues about freshness.

Using a near population of offenders on federal supervised release, the current study examined the effects of criminogenic (e.g., misconduct) and desistance-promoting (e.g., work, education, and visitation) factors occurring within prison along with the effects of importation factors (e.g., arrest onset, federal criminal history rank, and demographics) in relation to functioning/compliance on supervised release. Institutional misconduct and specifically drug/alcohol misconduct reduced postrelease functioning/compliance, while the effects for visitation were limited. Prison work and educational experiences had no effect on supervised release outcomes. The most consistent predictor of supervision failure was age of arrest onset and to a lesser extent federal criminal history rank that is supportive of importation and life-course perspectives.

Based on the manner in which stable isotopes fractionate in natural systems, they allow scientists to address a wide array of research topics ranging from tracking climatic shifts, ascertaining organisms' migratory patterns, matching organisms to their diets and/or environments, assessing food web bioenergetics, documenting ecosystem changes through time, measuring soil carbon budgets and soil microbial activity, etc. Hence, it may be a viable option to use stable isotopes to investigate stream and food web ecology with students. Students with no prior experience working with stable isotopes successfully met learning objectives by completing the requisite field and laboratory protocols, analysing data, interpreting results, and communicating their findings in a report modelled after a peer-reviewed scientific journal article. While this activity focused on food web ecology in a stream ecosystem, the method is repeatable, cost-effective, and can be modified relatively easily to evaluate food webs in virtually any other ecosystem.

Surprisingly, PS-b-PDMS reinforced composites display comparable mechanical performance to silica-modified analogs, even though the modulus of PS is much smaller than that of silica and there is no evidence of percolation with respect to the rigid PS domains. We have found that a few unique characteristics contribute to the reinforcing performance of PS b PDMS. The strong self-assembly behavior promotes batch-to-batch repeatability by having well-dispersed fillers. The structure and size of the fillers depend on the loading and characteristics of both filler and matrix, along with the shear effect. The reinforcing effect of PS-b-PDMS is mostly brought by the entanglements between the corona layer of the filler and the matrix, rather than the hydrodynamic reinforcement of the PS phase.

However, increasing standardized ileal digestible Lys per Mcal metabolizable energy (SID Lys:ME) above requirement has been shown to mitigate reduced performance seen during a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus challenge. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of increasing the dietary SID Lys:ME from 100% National Research Council (NRC) requirement to 120% of the requirement in vaccinated (vac+; modified live vaccine Ingelvac PRRS) and non-vaccinated (vac-; no PRRS vaccine) grower pigs subjected to a PRRSV challenge. In addition, the dietary formulation approach to achieve the 120% ratio by increasing Lys relative to energy (HL) or diluting energy in relation to Lys (LE) was evaluated. This allowed us to test the hypothesis that pigs undergoing a health challenge would have the ability to eat to their energy needs. Within vaccine status, 195 mixed-sex pigs, vac+ (35.2 +/- 0.60 kg body weight [BW]) and vac- (35.2 +/- 0.65 kg BW) were randomly allotted to one of three dietary treatments (2.67, 3.23, or 3.22 g SID Lys:ME) for a 42-d PRRS virus challenge study representing 100%, 120%, and 120% of NRC requirement, respectively. Pigs were randomly allotted across two barns, each containing 24 pens with 7 to 10 pigs per pen (8 pens per diet per vaccine status). On day post-inoculation 0, both barns were inoculated with PRRSV and started on experimental diets. Within vaccine status, weekly and overall challenge period pig performance were assessed. In both vac+ (P < 0.05) and vac- (P < 0.05) pigs, the HL and LE diets increased end BW and overall average daily gain (ADG) ADG compared with pigs fed the control diet (P < 0.05). Overall, average daily feed intake (ADFI) during the challenge period was greater (P < 0.05) for pigs fed the LE diet compared with pigs fed control and HL treatments, regardless of vaccine status (20% and 17% higher ADFI than the control in vac+ and vac- pigs, respectively). The HL vac+ pigs had the greatest gain to feed (G:F) compared with the control and LE pigs (0.438 vs. 0.394 and 0.391 kg/kg, respectively; P < 0.01). Feed efficiency was not impacted (P > 0.10) by treatment in the vac- pigs. In summary, PRRSV-challenged grower pigs consumed feed to meet their energy needs as indicated by the increase in ADFI when energy was diluted in the (LE) diet, compared with control pigs. In both PRRS vac+ and vac- pigs subsequently challenged with PRRSV, regardless of formulation approach, fed 120% SID Lys:ME diets resulted in enhanced overall growth performance.

J	Hallmark, B; Dong, J				Hallmark, Bryce; Dong, Jing			Developing Roadway Safety Models for Winter Weather Conditions Using a Feature Selection Algorithm	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							LEARNING-METHODS	Inclement winter weather such as snow, sleet, and freezing rain significantly impacts roadway safety. To assess the safety implications of winter weather, maintenance operations, and traffic operations, various crash frequency models have been developed. In this study, several datasets, including for weather, snowplow operations, and traffic information, were combined to develop a robust crash frequency model for winter weather conditions. When developing statistical models using such large-scale multivariate datasets, one of the challenges is to determine which explanatory variables should be included in the model. This paper presents a feature selection framework using a machine-learning algorithm known as the Boruta algorithm and exhaustive search to select a list of variables to be included in a negative binomial crash frequency model. This paper's proposed feature selection framework generates consistent and intuitive results because the feature selection process reduces the complexity of interactions among different variables in the dataset. This enables our crash frequency model to better help agencies identify effective ways to improve roadway safety via winter maintenance operations. For example, increased plowing operations before the start of storms are associated with a decrease in crash rates. Thus, pretreatment operations can play a significant role in mitigating the impact of winter storms.

Long-term management of congestive heart failure secondary to mitral stenosis in a ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta)	JAVMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; VALVE DISEASE; HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY; DOPPLER-ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY; CLINICAL-EFFICACY; RHEUMATIC-FEVER; PIMOBENDAN; DOGS; BENAZEPRIL	CASE DESCRIPTION A 15-year-old sexually intact female ring-tailed lemur ( Lemur catta) was evaluated for a heart murmur and progressive radiographic cardiomegaly. CLINICAL FINDINGS The lemur was clinically normal at the time of initial evaluation. Results of transthoracic echocardiography performed when the animal was anesthetized indicated mitral valve stenosis and severe left atrial dilation. Three months later, signs of left-sided congestive heart failure (CHF; coughing, exercise intolerance, and tachypnea) were observed and confirmed by the presence of radiographic pulmonary edema. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Medical treatment that consisted of aspirin, benazepril, furosemide, pimobendan, spironolactone, and ultimately torsemide in lieu of furosemide successfully controlled the lemur's clinical signs for 33 months after the development of CHF. Euthanasia was then elected on the basis of perceived poor quality of life because tachypnea became refractory to progressively higher dosages of diuretic. Necropsy confirmed mitral stenosis with severe left atrial dilation and chronic pulmonary congestion. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The present report described the long-term medical management of CHF secondary to mitral stenosis in a lemur. Mitral stenosis was suspected to be a congenital defect, similar to the cause of mitral stenosis reported for dogs and cats, rather than to be an acquired change in association with rheumatic heart disease as commonly occurs for people. The lemur's CHF was well managed for 33 months with treatment, including pimobendan, which was well tolerated.

J	Humphrey, D; Becker, S; Lee, J; Haydon, K; Greiner, L				Humphrey, Dalton; Becker, Spenser; Lee, Jason; Haydon, Keith; Greiner, Laura			Evaluation of a novel threonine source for nursery pig diets	TRANSLATIONAL ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						nursery; pig; threonine	L-LYSINE SULFATE; CENTER-DOT-HCL; AMINO-ACIDS; PERFORMANCE; BIOAVAILABILITY; BIOEFFICACY	Four hundred and eighty (PIC 337 X 1050, PIC Genus, Hendersonville, TN) pigs were used to evaluate a novel threonine source (ThrPro, CJ America Bio, Fort Dodge, IA) for nursery pigs from approximately 7 to 20 kg body weight (BW). After weaning, pigs were sorted by sex and fed a common diet for 1 wk. Upon completion of the first week, pigs were sorted into randomized complete blocks, equalized by weight, within 16 replications. Pigs were allocated to one of three dietary treatments: positive control (POS)-standard ileal digestible threonine-to-lysine ratio (SID; Thr:Lys) 0.60, negative control (NEG)-SID Thr:Lys <= 0.46, and alternative Thr source (TEST)-SID Thr:Lys 0.60. The alternative Thr source included fermentative biomass and was assumed to contain 75% Thr and a digestibility coefficient of 100% based on the manufacturer's specifications. All other nutrients met or exceeded the NRC recommendations. Growth and intake data were analyzed as repeated measures with a compound symmetry covariance structure using the MIXED procedure in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with pen as the experimental unit. Treatment, phase, the interaction between treatment and phase, and block were included as fixed effects in the model. Differences in total removals were tested using Fisher's Exact Test of PROC FREQ. Results were considered significant at P <= 0.05 and considered a trend at P > 0.05 and P <= 0.10. During the first 14 d, pigs fed TEST had decreased gain-to-feed ratio (G:F; 0.77 vs. 0.80, P = 0.022) compared to POS and increased G:F (0.77 vs. 0.73, P < 0.001) compared to NEG. Over days 14-28, pigs fed TEST had similar G:F (0.71 vs. 0.70, P = 0.112) compared to POS and increased G:F (0.71 vs. 0.63, P < 0.001) compared to NEG. Overall (days 0-28), pigs fed TEST had similar average daily gain (ADG; 0.47 vs. 0.47 kg/d, P = 0.982) and G:F (0.76 vs. 0.74, P = 0.395) compared to POS and increased ADG (0.47 vs. 0.43 kg/d, P < 0.001) and G:F (0.76 vs. 0.67, P < 0.001) compared to NEG. The average daily feed intake was not significantly different across treatments for the entirety of the study. In conclusion, the replacement of crystalline L-Thr with a novel Thr source resulted in similar growth performance in nursery pigs from approximately 7 to 20 kg.

This incompatibility is exacerbated by surface roughness yet advances in wearables and bioelectronics call for their integration. Mesoscale mechanical bonds, however, transcend the necessities of surface energy matching while taking advantage of surface texture. Herein, transient carrier fluids, particle size polydispersity, and capillary-driven autonomous size-sorting are exploited to conformally jam undercooled liquid metal particles on textured soft substrate. The well packed undercooled metal particles are then chemically activated to induce phase change, leading to a solid electrically conductive metal trace. Static and dynamic deposition of the particles is amenable to this surface-templated printing of conductive traces. This process allows for printing across surfaces with varying surface features like on the brain, on paper (asymmetric porosity), or across smooth and rough brain sections. By tuning particle size and slurry concentration, good particle packing is demonstrated on a multi-scale rough surface like a rose flower. This printing method is therefore compatible with delicate (low modulus), heat sensitive, and textured substrates hence compatible with biological tissues and organic substrates.

Probabilistic zero forcing yields a discrete dynamical system governed by a Markov chain. Since in a connected graph any one vertex can eventually color the entire graph blue using probabilistic zero forcing, the expected time to do this is studied. Given a Markov transition matrix for a probabilistic zero forcing process, an exact formula is established for expected propagation time. Markov chains are applied to determine bounds on expected propagation time for various families of graphs.

Consistent with churning, the same factors that increase retail sales in a local market also increase new retail firm entry and either increase or do not affect retail firm exit. Evidence suggests that there is more churning in urban than in rural markets. Similar evidence is found using a sample of national firm entry and exit into local markets. If churning increases productivity growth, then the greater churning rate in urban markets is another source of agglomeration advantages in thick markets.

ClosureTurf is a synthetic turf closure system that services as the hydraulic barrier to separate the waste and protect human health and the environment. It consists of a structured geomembrane, an engineered turf, and a specified infill. Wind tunnel testing was conducted on a scaled landfill model constructed with a 3H:1V slope on one end, a top deck, and a 4H:1V slope on the other end. The pressure distribution along the closure system surface was measured using pressure taps. Wind tunnel tests were also conducted on an exposed geomembrane surface. The measured pressure distribution along the exposed geomembrane surface was compared to that along the closure system, as well as the semi-empirical solution by the widely accepted Giroud method. The results of the wind tunnel tests can be used in engineering practice to evaluate whether the closure system has sufficient ballast to protect it from wind uplift under a design wind speed.

J	Ortiz, D; Palmer, J; Wilkinson, G				Ortiz, David; Palmer, Jason; Wilkinson, Grace			Detecting changes in statistical indicators of resilience prior to algal blooms in shallow eutrophic lakes	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						critical transition; cyanobacteria; early warning indicator; harmful algal bloom; lake; regime shift	REGIME SHIFTS; CYANOBACTERIAL TOXINS; FRESH-WATERS; ECOSYSTEMS; ROLES	Algal blooms in lakes and reservoirs can be considered regime shifts from a clear-water to algae-dominated state that often occurs abruptly. Under experimental conditions, these regime shifts have been predicted from rises in variance and autocorrelation (generic resilience indicators) of state variables monitored at a high frequency. The goal of this study was to evaluate the behavior of resilience indicators prior to a critical transition in lakes that naturally experience algal blooms. Ambient lake conditions provide several potential hurdles that could inhibit the detection of meaningful changes in resilience indicators prior to a critical transition such as stochastic nutrient loading, spatial complexity, and decreased resilience due to higher baseline nutrient concentrations. We compiled five lake-years of high-frequency monitoring of chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, dissolved oxygen, and pH from four hypereutrophic lakes. Despite the factors that might hinder detecting statistical indicators of changing resilience in hypereutrophic ecosystems, we found that a rise in resilience indicators did occur prior to a critical transition in three out of four possible lake-years, with rise beginning between 5 and 33 d prior. In one lake-year, a critical transition occurred soon after the monitoring began, preventing detection of rising variance or autocorrelation signals which are calculated using a 21-d rolling window. These results add to the growing body of evidence that rises in resilience indicators can be detected in ecosystems prior to a regime shift if monitoring programs are properly designed to capture the dynamics; however, continued research is needed to better understand the conditions under which resilience indicators may be useful as an early warning detection tool for lake management.

Practical aspects of PRRSV RNA detection in processing fluids collected in commercial swine farms	PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE			English	Article						Swine; PRRS virus; Processing fluids; Surveillance; Monitoring	RESPIRATORY SYNDROME VIRUS; HERDS	Processing fluid samples are easily collected under field conditions and provide the means to test more piglets more frequently in a practical way, thereby improving PRRSV surveillance. However, a deeper understanding of the diagnostic characteristics of this newly described sample type is still required. Therefore, the objective of this field-based study was to determine the relationship between viremic piglets and the detection of PRRSV RNA in processing fluid samples. In two PRRSV-positive breeding herds, processing fluids (n = 77) and individual piglet serum samples (n = 834) were collected from 77 litters in three sampling events and tested for PRRSV RNA. Among the 77 litters in the study, 55 litters (71.4%) contained no viremic piglets and processing fluids tested negative for PRRSV RNA. Among the 22 (28.6%) litters with >= 1 viremic piglets, 10 litters contained a single viremic piglet and 5 of the 10 processing fluids from this group tested positive for PRRSV RNA. Based on a fitted mixed effects logistic regression model, the probability of detecting PRRSV RNA in processing fluids was highly dependent on the number of viremic piglets contributing to the sample. When the within-litter prevalence was >= 39%, the probability of detecting PRRSV RNA in processing fluids was >= 95%. By extension, the results suggest that pooling processing fluids from several litters increases the probability of PRRSV RNA detection because of the greater likelihood of including multiple litters each with >= 1 viremic piglets. In contemporary breeding herds that use processing fluid samples for PRRSV surveillance, the diagnostic costs associated with testing 100% of the processing-age piglet population can be estimated at (sic)0.077 ($0.086 USD) per pig weaned. In contrast, to achieve an equivalent testing coverage with the use of individual piglet serum samples, the diagnostic costs associated would be (sic)4.48 ($5.00 USD) per pig weaned. Processing fluid represents a practical, reliable and efficient method to surveil breeding herds for PRRSV because it allows for continuous surveillance at a low cost.

J	Thapa, R; Hallmark, S; Oneyear, N				Thapa, Raju; Hallmark, Shauna; Oneyear, Nicole			Braking behavior of major approach turning vehicles at rural two-way stop controlled intersections: A naturalistic driving study	TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION			English	Article						Reaction point; turning vehicles; braking zone; speed limit; upstream of intersection	LATERAL POSITION; SPEED	Objective: Using naturalistic driving data, this study analyzed the driving behavior of major approach right and left turning vehicles to minor approach at rural two-way stop controlled intersections by detecting the location where drivers reacted to the upcoming intersection to complete a turning maneuver. Methods: The study used 449 time series traces from 29 two-way stop controlled intersections across five states for the analysis. All 449 traces were associated to free flow condition with driving not obstructed by the vehicle ahead. Each time series trace was analyzed to check the point drivers first reacted to the intersection for the turning maneuver and this point was called the reaction point. Braking Behavior of Major Approach Turning Vehicles at Rural Two-Way Stop Controlled Intersections: A Naturalistic Driving Study Results: The results from this study showed that right turning vehicles began reacting, in general, sooner than left turning vehicles. More than 75% of drivers showed a reaction within 300 meters upstream of intersection for both types of turning maneuver. The study found driving speed at the reaction point significantly affecting the initial point of reaction. Drivers who were traveling faster than the posted speed limit were associated with a reaction point farther upstream than vehicles traveling at the speed limit. On-pavement marking upstream of the intersection was found to be associated with longer reaction distance, while posted intersection ahead warning signs showed a reverse effect. The result provides information on braking zone of turning vehicles at intersections which has implication on the placement of different countermeasures upstream at the major approach.

Unfortunately, research has produced variable estimates of how large the dark figure is. The current study sought to replicate recent studies of federal sexual offenders about the dark figure of sexual offending. We also extended the knowledge base by providing additional correlational analyses to see whether self-reported and official sexual offending have shared or divergent correlates. Overall, 73.8% of federal sexual offenders reported prior contact victims, which is higher than, but generally consistent with, prior prevalence estimates of 55-69% in studies of federal correctional clients. In the current data, clients convicted of child pornography possession or receipt and who had no official record of sexual abuse nevertheless reported contact sexual offenses in more than 59% of cases.

Pavement condition data is collected by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) and stored in a Pavement-Management Information System (PMIS). In the state of Iowa, the overall pavement condition is quantified using the Pavement Condition Index (PCI), which is a weighted average of indices representing different types of distress, roughness, and deflection. Deterioration models of PCI as a function of time were developed for the different pavement types using two modeling approaches. The first approach is the long/short-term memory (LSTM), a subset of a recurrent neural network. The second approach, used by the Iowa DOT, is developing individual regression models for each section of the different pavement types. A comparison is made between the two approaches to assess the accuracy of each model. The results show that the LSTM model achieved a higher prediction accuracy over time for all different pavement types.

Accordingly, gene expression was assayed for inbreds 'B73' and 'Mo17' across five contiguous silk sections. Half of the maize genes (similar to 20,000) are expressed in silks, mostly in spatiotemporally dynamic patterns. In particular, emergence triggers strong differential expression of similar to 1,500 genes collectively enriched for gene ontology terms associated with abiotic and biotic stress responses, hormone signaling, cell-cell communication, and defense metabolism. Further, a meta-analysis of published maize transcriptomic studies on seedling stress showed that silk emergence elicits an upregulated transcriptomic response that overlaps strongly with both abiotic and biotic stress responses. Although the two inbreds revealed similar silk transcriptomic programs overall, genotypic expression differences were observed for 5,643 B73-Mo17 syntenic gene pairs and collectively account for >50% of genome-wide expression variance. Coexpression clusters, including many based on genotypic divergence, were identified and interrogated via ontology-term enrichment analyses to generate biological hypotheses for future research. Ultimately, dissecting how gene expression changes along the length of silks and between husk-encased and emerged states offers testable models for silk development and plant response to environmental stresses.

J. Popovich & Farrar is a new species widespread in the central and southern Rocky Mountains from Alberta and Montana south to New Mexico, with additional populations in the Cypress Hills of Saskatchewan and the Black Hills of Wyoming and South Dakota. Based on allozyme banding patterns, it is inferred to be an allotetraploid with B. pallidum W. H. Wagner as one parent and another, as yet undescribed, diploid species (B. "farrarii'') as the other parent. Genetically, B. furculatum is distinguished from B. pallidum by exhibiting fixed heterozygous loci in which expressed alleles of one of the genomic contributions matches those of B. pallidum, whereas many alleles of the other genomic contribution have not been detected in B. pallidum, but are displayed by B. "farrarii.'' Morphologically, a suite of leaf characters differentiates B. furculatum from B. pallidum, particularly a more pronounced bowed or wishbone-like junction of sporophore and trophophore. Gradations in morphology and color between the two species have led to erroneous reports of B. pallidum in the Rocky Mountains. A key to differentiate B. furculatum from similar species is presented.

Research Note: Comparison of chicken blood chemistry and electrolyte parameters between the portable i-STAT1 clinical analyzer and VetScan VS2 serum biochemistry panel using Hy-Line commercial white-egg laying hens	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						blood gas; blood chemistry; laying hen; white egg layer; i-STAT1	GAS	The i-STAT1 clinical analyzer has become an increasingly popular tool in clinical production animal medicine as it can provide pen-side results in a cost effective and timely manner when compared to standard benchtop serum biochemistry blood gas and chemistry analyses. This study compares the results of the portable Abbott i-STAT1 analyzer and the Abaxis VetScan VS2 for glucose (Glu, mg/dL), ionized Ca (mmol/L), Na (mmol/L), and K(mmol/L) values. Three genetically distinct commercial varieties (CV) of Hy-Line white-egg laying hens are used in this study (Hy-Line W-36, Hy-Line W-80, and Hy-Line W-80+). Thirty blood samples (n = 10 per CV) were obtained in the production house from the brachial vein and concurrently analyzed by the i-STAT1 portable device. Serum from 22 of these same samples was analyzed via VetScan VS2, a benchtop serum clinical biochemistry analyzer, using VetScan Avian/Reptilian Profile Plus reagent rotors. A paired T-test was used to test for statistical differences in means between the 2 instruments for each of the parameters. Parameters with significant mean differences were then subject to correlation and regression analysis to further evaluate relationships between the results from the 2 methods. Significant differences between means were found for Glu, Na, and K levels. Ca levels were found to be not directly comparable by the 2 analysis instruments. This comparison elucidates the importance of clinical analyzer validations when applying different strategies of diagnostic medicine in poultry.	[Sauer, Z.

OP exposure causes cholinergic crisis and status epilepticus (SE) because of irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase that can be life-threatening if left untreated. OP survivors develop long-term morbidity, such as cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction, because of oxidative stress and progressive neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, which act as disease promoters. Current medical countermeasures (MCMs) do not mitigate these pathologies. Therefore, our goal was to target these disease promoters using diapocynin (DPO), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, in addition to MCMs, in a rat diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) model. The DFP-intoxicated rats were treated with DPO (300 mg/kg, oral, six doses, 12-h intervals) or vehicle 2 h following behavioral SE termination with diazepam. The DPO treatment significantly rescued DFP-induced motor impairment and attenuated epileptiform spiking during the first 72 h after DFP exposure in severely seizing rats despite no difference in epileptiform spike rate between the vehicle and DPO groups in mild SE rats. DPO significantly reduced DFP-induced reactive astrogliosis, neurodegeneration, GP91(phox), glutathiolated protein, serum nitrite, and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukins (ILs) IL-1 alpha, IL-6, IL-2, IL-17A, leptin, and IP-10, in the hippocampus. Collectively, these data support a neuroprotective role of DPO in an OP-induced neurotoxicity model.

Smith) (Lcpidoptera:Noctuidac), is a recent invasive pest of Africa and Asia. This insect causes economic damage to maize (Zen mays L.) primarily through leaf and ear tissue feeding. The pest is resistant to several classes of insecticide and several Bt-maize toxins. Native resistance in maize to fall armyworm could be used with existing control tactics to enhance control of this insect. The objective for this study was to evaluate maize germplasm, developed from Thailand and maintained by the U.S. National Plant Germplasm System, for resistance to leaf feeding fall armyworm. Plants were grown in the field and artificially infested at the seven-leaf stage with fall armyworms. Visual rating scores for leaf feeding damage were recorded at 7 and 14 days post infestation. Scores for maize germplasm Ames 26254 were not different than the resistant check, GT-FAWCC(C5), and germplasm P1 506347 and P1 690324 were not significantly different from Ames 26254. In total, five Thailand maize germplasms received 14-day damage scores of <= 6.0 across both years of testing and were considered moderately resistant to fall armyworm leaf feeding. These maize germplasms are tropical and require breeding to adapt progeny for research in temperate areas.	[Abel, Craig A.; Scott, M.

J	Sharma, S; Wong, J				Sharma, Sugam; Wong, Johnny			Three-button gateway smart home interface (TrueSmartface) for elderly: Design, development and deployment	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Three-button; Smart; Home; Interface; Elderly		With the growing age, the older adults experience gradual health, physical as well cognitive, declining. Oftentimes, the degree of developed health concerns is severe enough for the inevitable need of most likely a permanent caregiver or resource-rich but overly expensive assisted or nursing facility. The increasingly technical richness of the science advancements helps elevate at least most aspects of human life and the existence of smart home is one such outcome that has attained popularity, maturity and acceptability over the short period of time, especially in the communities of seniors, where it promises them an independent daily living. The smart home is an intelligent, technical, and automated cyber-physical infrastructure, which consists of a number of appliances and devices embedded or attached in physical environment. Some of them will be contextually-triggered, however, there is also a potential need for an efficient interface (graphical or non-graphical) to operate some. The design of such graphical interfaces is not so rudimentary, rather ought to be a comprehensive human-centered design that imposes very minimal physical and cognitive stress on a senior inhabitant. In this research work, we design and develop one such graphical interface (apt for desktop, laptop and mobile devices), which is based on some newly devised hypotheses, validated through literature and informal surveys. At every stage of the design, a three-button constraint is precisely persevered and the interface is successfully deployed into the Smart Home Lab at Iowa State University. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the many reasons students undermatch, this phenomenon is likely to continue; yet, we know little about the characteristics that may be related to degree attainment for this population of students. Utilizing the ELS: 2002 national dataset, we developed an operationalization of undermatch and then applied this operationalization to the BPS: 04/09 national dataset (N = 11,260). Using logistic regression methods, we identified institutional and student characteristics that are associated with degree attainment for undermatched students. Starting at a 4-year institution, completing at least precalculus, having at least one parent with a college education, being female, and being socially and academically integrated into the institution were positively associated with degree attainment. Our results emphasize the critical influence of nYYonacademic factors on degree attainment for undermatched students.

Herein, by using undercooled metal particles, differences in modulus and processing temperatures can be overcome. Adoption of autonomous processes such as self-filtration, capillary pressure, and evaporative concentration leads to enhanced packing, stabilization (jamming) and point sintering with phase change to create solid metal replicas of complex bio-based features. Differentiation of subtle differences between cultivars of the rose flower with reproduction over large areas shows that this biomimetic metal patterning (BIOMAP) is a versatile method to replicate biological features either as positive or negative reliefs irrespective of the substrate. Using rose petal patterns, we illustrate the versatility of bio-templated mapping with undercooled metal particles at ambient conditions, and with unprecedented efficiency for metal structures.

Pregnancy and Parenting Among Youth Transitioning from Foster Care: A Mixed Methods Study	CHILD & YOUTH CARE FORUM			English	Article						Transitioning foster youth; Pregnancy; Parenting; Mixed methods	SEX-EDUCATION; MOTHERS; ADOLESCENTS; EXPERIENCES; OUTCOMES; RISK; RESILIENCE; PREVENTION; CONSTRUCT; SERVICES	Background Over 400,000 children and youth are in foster care at any given time in the United States, with nearly one-third exiting care between ages 13 and 20. Pregnancy among women in this population is nearly double national averages, with one-third becoming pregnant by age 17 and nearly half of those experiencing repeat pregnancies by age 19. Research is needed about the sources of formal and informal information and support foster care youth receive about pregnancy and parenting, their access to and use of contraception, and the involvement of fathers/non-custodial parents in raising children. Objective The purpose of the current study was to better understand the experiences of foster care youth to inform policy and practice recommendations that address the high rate of unintended pregnancies and early parenting among youth transitioning from foster care. Methods This is a secondary analysis of data from a mixed-method study with a concurrent explanatory design including survey and focus group data. Complete survey responses included 81 participants (femalen = 61; malen = 20) between the ages of 18-25, and 9 females took part in two focus groups. Results Sexual experiences were common for foster care youth and they reported few educational opportunities and supportive relationships. Themes that emerged from the focus group discussions centered on socialization about reproduction, social support, and parenting. Conclusions Access to educational opportunities and supportive personal relationships were lower than what would be expected from national estimates of non-foster care youth. Findings from both the survey and focus group data suggest enhancing programs for foster care youth with a specific focus on education and support for reproductive health, pregnancy, and parenting.
